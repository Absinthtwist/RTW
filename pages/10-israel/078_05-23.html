    <h1>Day 78: Jerusalem to Firenze</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 23 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Jerusalem, Israel to Florence, Italy</h3>   
    <p>I take my time but just can’t drag my feet slow enough to get me out of my
        hostel before 0900. I’m supposed to take the light-rail to the Central Bus
        Terminal, but elect to walk the three kilometers. I’m way early, and it’s a
        nice morning.</p>
    <p>I get to the Bus Terminal, and with a little help I find the right bus. Less
        than an hour I’m let off near the airport. I decide to just walk the
        remainder, but the nice man at the security desk with the assault rifle
        directs me to another bus for the remainder. The bus ride is short, but it
        would have been a far longer walk than I had imagined. Still, at 1130, I’m
        about five and a half hours early for my flight. I’ve been amply warned that
        Israel has some of the most intense security, and absolutely zero that I’ve
        seen so far has dissuaded me from that understanding. Plus there’s the
        matter of my missing passport stamp. I think that’s gonna haunt me.</p>
    <h3>1430</h3>
        <p>Made it through security, which, gotta say, does not disappoint. Aside
            from the biggest X-ray machine I’ve ever seen, and going through my bag
            almost item by item with frequent wipe-checks for explosive residue, what
            the security does best, their real secret, is eye contact. Direct engagement.
            I’m not talking about great customer service, I’m talking about a very polite
            but very stern interrogation at many points through the system. Who am I?
            Where am I going? How long was I here? What did I see? What did I do? It
            was quite an experience. And they have many many X-ray machines and
            metal detectors, and they really take their time with each person. Thorough,
            however long it takes. No security theatre here. These guys are for real. I
            see why they have the reputation that they do.</p>
    <h3>2330</h3>
    <p>Florence. I’m at my hostel and calling it a night. Tomorrow I play.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
