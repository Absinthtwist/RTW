    <h1>Day 75: Jerusalem Day</h1>
    <h2>Sunday 20 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Jerusalem, Israel</h3>   
    <p>I’m awake and out the door by 0830. My sleep was interrupted several
        times by groups of people walking the streets singing with great enthusiasm
        and joy. Fantastic to listen to, even at the cost of some sleep. Today is a
        special day, and I am blessed in my timing: this is Jerusalem Day. It marks
        the return of Jerusalem to Israel back in 1967. Probably not so song-worthy
        in Palestine, I fully honor that, but I made a deal with myself when I chose
        to come here: forget politics, just be Jewish while here. Just as I would have
        celebrated in any other country.</p>
    <p>My tour today starts at 1100, so I take my time walking through the Old
        City, observing the differences in character between the four quarters. The
        Jewish Quarter feels very homey. Lived in. Children being led by teachers,
        potted plants. Clean. Loved.</p>
    <p>Realizing I should eat before the tour, I grab a calzone and have a seat. The
        city feels more patriotic. Groups with Israeli flags walk by. Large groups of
        soldiers, young like college students (most everyone serves in the Israeli
        army). Nothing quite says sexy like a woman in uniform with her own
        machine gun, complete with grenade launcher attachment. Most of them
        seem less on duty and more on picnic. Yes they are soldiers, but today they
        have a lightness to them.</p>
    <p>At 1100 I set off with a large tour group, thirty of us. We make stops at the
        Dormition Church (where the Virgin Mary “fell asleep,” then was taken to
        Heaven by Christ), the room where the Last Supper took place (though it
        was built around 900 AD), the possible resting place of King David, just for
        a start. It’s important to stress that while many of these places may not be
        exactly as tradition holds, the location is near enough, and they still hold
        profound symbolic value. Though I confess this makes those things we are
        more certain of all the more powerful.</p>
    <p>From here we stretch our legs and walk to the Western Wall. We also get in
        line for the Temple Mount, which is only open to non-Muslims for an houra day. We take turns holding a place in line and going in to see the Western
        Wall. This is my second visit to the Wall in as many days. It’s not as packed
        as it was on Shabbat, but it still holds a great deal of power. After a bit more
        of waiting, we are led up to the Temple Mount, the location most sacred to
        Jews, the place where the Holiest of Holies, the Great Temple, containing
        the Ark of the Covenant, once stood. This was what Christ came to
        Jerusalem to see. This is where He got mad at the money changers. But that
        temple was completely destroyed by the Romans, and the Jewish people
        have pretty much been kept out of this area, at least not permitted to pray
        or rebuild their temple, for two millennia. Now the Temple Mount is the
        site of two Muslim buildings: the El-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the
        Rock. This plateau was man made, shortly before the time of Christ, to
        expand the ground at the site of the top of the hill itself. The top of that hill
        is now the centerpiece of the Dome of the Rock, now sacred to Muslims.
        This is the place where Mohammed ascended to Heaven to speak with God
        and return with new rules to live by.</p>
    <p>We exit the temple mount and stop for a lunch of hummus and falafel. I
        chat with an artist lady from Hong Kong and a couple from Luxembourg as
        we eat.</p>
    <p>Immediately outside the restaurant we find one of the Stations of the Cross,
        the Via Dolorosa. We follow, marking the stops, until we pass through a
        tight collection of markets and come out to stand before an open space and
        a doorway. It doesn’t really look like a church. Hemmed in on all sides by
        other buildings, classical columns on either side of the door. It seems tall,
        perhaps three stories? It’s hard to tell from here. The outside is not that
        remarkable. But this is it: the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. And while
        some sites are more traditional than reliable, history feels relatively
        confident in saying yes: this is the place where Christ was crucified. The
        church also holds the cave into which He was entombed, and from which
        He rose. Immediately upon entering is a winding staircase to my right. I
        climb and am at the level of the top of Golgotha. The place is packed full of
        people, which only heightens for me that feeling of being overwhelmed.
        This is all just too much. I try to take in what I can, but know I will have to
        come back later, when there are fewer people, and no tour group to keep
        pace with. I take the steps and descend to find the group all waiting for me,
        and just as I think I’m getting my feet under me, I am led to the tomb. I
        can’t really articulate the impact of all of this. I think at some point I sort ofshut down and just became a history student. I must return here before I
        leave Jerusalem.</p>
    <p>We step out into the sun, and it takes me a moment to reorient. It’s 1600
        now, and the tour has gone on longer than expected, and I am most
        grateful. We all part ways, and I drift back to my neighborhood. I figure I
        am pretty much done for the day. I eventually return to my hostel, where I
        charge up my camera and chill out, looking forward to Bethlehem
        tomorrow. I figure I am done for the day. But the day is not yet done with
        me.</p>
    <p>Around 2000 I hear it again, as I had last night while trying to sleep:
        crowds of cheering and singing people, their joy infectious. But this isn’t s
        small band of people as before, this is…well, everybody. It’s a huge crowd
        streaming past my window, all moving with purpose. I hesitate for the
        briefest of moments, but Then i think: this is why I have come, for moments
        like this. Of course I’m going. Not stopping to find my socks or shoes, I am
        out the door in my flip-flops. I’m glad I had the presence of mind to grab
        my wallet and phone. The camera too was left behind (good thing the
        phone takes pics).</p>
    <p>The crowd, all happy and enthusiastic, many waving Israeli flags, all seem
        to know where they are going. I just hop into that river and let the current
        lead me. It was no real surprise to see us heading toward the Western Wall.
        I know this all must be for the previously discussed holiday Jerusalem Day,
        and I feel a bit conspicuous without a yarmulke, but no one seemed to care.
        The nearest American comparison to all of this doesn’t really feel like the
        Fourth if July, it feels more like a rock concert. Crowds all packed in close,
        full of excitement, but of all ages: from the casual, to the most Jewish
        Orthodox in appearance, to a father dancing with his toddler daughter, all
        are welcome.</p>
    <p>We arrive at the Western Wall, and it is packed to bursting. There are many
        flags waiving around, and there is an official looking stage with an official
        looking man making a speech in Hebrew (I don’t understand one bit of it).
        Soon, however, the speech maker is replaced by a band, and music starts.
        The crowd is clapping and jumping up and down, and soon people are in
        great chain circles, holding hands and dancing around. I stand like a block
        of wood for a few seconds then jump in. I am welcomed without question,
        and I dance and dance and dance.</p>
    <p>It is wonderful. I don’t know of anything I have ever experienced to
        compare it to. No, not any rock concert, certainly no Independence Day
        barbecue. The only thing I can imagine that this may have been like was the
        sixties. So much excitement. So much joy. So much harmony, and one-ness.
        So much love.</p>
    <p>It was a good night.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
