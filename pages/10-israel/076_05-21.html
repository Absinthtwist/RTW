    <h1>Day 76: There Is Always Something You Can Do</h1>
    <h2>Monday 21 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Jerusalem, Israel</h3>   
    <p>I am up early today, ready for Bethlehem. I arrive at my pick up point, a
        hotel about a kilometer away, a few minutes prior to pick up time, 0830,
        but see nothing that looks like a tour group. I wait it out till 0900 and throw
        in the towel. I write an email to the tour company to see if anything comes,
        but with a trip this complex, you gotta expect a few lumps. I ponder for a bit
        on what I should do, and by 0945 I am on the road and walking to Yad
        Vashem, the Holocaust Memorial Museum. It’s around five or six
        kilometers, and I decide it would make a nice tour of New Jerusalem.</p>
    <p>Alas that much of this route is uphill, but it’s still a very pleasant walk. By
        1115 I am at my destination, atop a hill surrounded by forest. It is very
        peaceful, very beautiful. Winded, I make my way to the cafeteria and have a
        croissant and a sprite. I see they have two cafeterias, with no overlap
        permitted: a dairy area and a meat area. Naturally, kosher laws would be
        well enforced here.</p>
    <p>Rested, I rent an audio tour and proceed. This is one of those things that
        nothing I say will adequately express what I experience here. So much, and
        so perfectly done. I cannot imagine how this could have been done better. I
        don’t think I want to give a blow by blow, just know that it was deeply
        moving, extremely informative, profoundly engaging. I lost track of time,
        and I was overwhelmed.</p>
    <p>Adjoining the museum is a garden memorializing all the non-Jews who
        risked their own lives to help. And most powerful of all, a memorial to the
        one and a half million children who were murdered in the Holocaust. The
        memorial was underground, in the dark. A room seemingly made of glass
        all around you, and one candle in the center, reflected a thousand thousand
        times, like standing in a star filled sky… as the names and ages of the lost
        are read aloud. My description is crude and clumsy, but this memorial is
        anything but. Everyone should stand here. Everyone should see this.
        Everyone should hear this. Everyone should feel this. So much that could
        have been will never be. So much, lost.</p>
    <p>Jerusalem has been a very overwhelming destination for me. And more
        than once I have felt that I have been given more than I know how to
        accept. But I keep trying, I keep trying. Jerusalem is ABSOLUTELY on the
        willing to see again list. And if I thought they would let me live here, I’d
        start learning Hebrew tomorrow.</p>
    <p>I think I can say that this has been the best part of my journey so far.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
    <p>“They came for the communists, and I did not object for I was not a
        communist.
        Then they came for the socialists, and I did not object for I was not a
        socialist.
        Then they came for the Jews, and I did not object for I was not a Jew.
        When they came for me, there was no one left to object…”
        - Martin Niemöller</p>
