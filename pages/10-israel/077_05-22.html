    <h1>Day 77: The Church Of The Holy Sepulchre</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 22 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Jerusalem, Israel</h3>   
    <p>I’m awake and out the door by 0630. I get a little lost on the winding near-
        empty streets, but eventually find my destination: the Church of the Holy
        Sepulchre. I arrive at 0700 and am happy to find the doors open. A few
        people here and there, but nothing like the crowds of the previous day. I
        move slowly. I take my time, each step deliberate. I take the stairs up to the
        site of the Crucifixion. In the room adjoining, a priest is giving service inSpanish to a small gathering. Eventually, I make my way back downstairs to
        a small altar marking the place from which the Virgin Mary and Mary
        Magdalen watched the Crucifixion. And then, turning round, to the
        breathtaking domed chamber containing the tomb of Christ. As I approach,
        I find two rows of benches, three each, and perhaps a dozen people, at
        most. I join them as a Catholic Mass is performed here, and the place of the
        resurrection, in Latin no less, complete with church organ echoing from
        these vast walls. I stay for the mass and take communion, and take my
        place in line with the others. From upstairs now descends a Greek Orthodox
        priest and a small gathering, singing solemnly, beautifully. Then, in small
        groups, we are allowed into the tomb.</p>
    <p>This church is unlike any building I have been in. It does not seem to have a
        central plan. It was created over the centuries, by different groups,
        sometimes with conflicting agendas. They share the same points of focus,
        and they have some common goals, but the conflict has produced the most
        stunning, organic, dreamlike church imaginable. One moment you walk on
        marble, the next on stone. The next you are under a vast gilded dome,
        beautifully frescoed. Byzantine, then Orthodox, then Armenien, then
        Coptic, then Catholic. Monuments built by the Christianized Romans stand
        next to those built by the Crusaders, next to those made twenty years ago.
        This does not feel like any ordinary church. Nor should it.</p>
    <p>After that, well, what can I really do to top that? With my Bethlehem plans
        deflated and not willing to drop more cash I really don’t have, I find myself
        with an extra day. I investigate the best way to get back to the airport. I do a
        little shopping. I wander. I take my time. The Old City of Jerusalem is really
        quite small, but still full of mysteries. I could spend a very long time here,
        lifetimes, and still keep discovering.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
