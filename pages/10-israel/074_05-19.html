    <h1>Day 74: The Center Of The World</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 19 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Jerusalem, Israel</h3>   
    <p>I arrived in Tel Aviv around 0030. The line for immigration is moving
        slower than I’m used to, but this being Israel, I’ve been prepared for that.
        When I get to the counter, there’s no casual glance and a stamp, the man
        gives me several serious, hard looks. He asks me where I’m coming from,
        how long I’ve been traveling, why I’m coming to Israel. Lots of stuff.
        Nothing unreasonable. And after a few minutes of this, he stamps a piece of
        paper, places it into my passport and hands it back to me. I move on to the
        door where someone else examines my passport again and takes the
        stamped paper. I get my passport and walk on without asking if that stamp
        was my visa and won’t I need it to leave the country, remind me to get to
        the airport extra early for my departure.</p>
    <p>m out the front door shortly after 0100 and I quickly squeeze into a
        crowded can on it’s way to Jerusalem. It’s a bit of a drive, and I’m worn out
        from doing nothing all day, but I manage to keep awake. I’m nearly the last
        to be dropped off, and it’s quite a shock, even in the dark, to see you’ve left
        the suburbs we’ve been driving through and are now inside what can only
        be described as a castle.</p>
    <p>I am let off just inside the Jaffa Gate, all is silent and empty around me, a
        few lights here and there, including a sign for police to quash any nerves.
        No real nerves, honestly, mostly I’m just stunned as I walk down David
        Street, a pedestrian walk, gradually heading down with occasional steps.
        The ground under my feet, including those steps, seem quite quite old.
        Everything around me reeks of age, and history. These walls are thick with
        ghosts of the past. Walking through the darkness, the only sound my own
        foot falls, is an amazingly intimate and wonderful introduction to this city.
        So many places I have come to have felt so impersonal. Not Jerusalem. I
        feel welcomed, like an old friend arriving at the door late at night. So
        wonderful to see you. Not sure what I was expecting from Jerusalem, but
        not this. I make my way to my hostel on David Street, make payment and
        the usual necessities, then crawl into my bed under a window. It’s hard to
        fall asleep, but eventually I do.</p>
    <p>I wake around 0800 and am dressed and out the door by 0830. I am
        surprised to find the streets so empty at this hour. I know it’s a bit early, butstill… And then I get it: this is Saturday. Shabbat. The Jewish day of rest.
        It’s the sort of thing I tried to pay attention to when planning my trip,
        apparently it slipped by till right now. Well, I remain undeterred and am
        curious to see how this will affect my day.</p>
    <p>I wander the labyrinthine streets, no real clue where I am. Old Jerusalem is
        really rather small, perhaps a square kilometer, divided into quarters: the
        Armenian Quarter, the Jewish Quarter, the Muslim Quarter, and the
        Christian Quarter. As I understand it, my hostel is in the Christian Quarter,
        right in the middle of a market area. I see a few people walking through the
        streets here and there, and follow the flow. Yarmulkas and other wardrobe
        queues tell me the people I am following are Jewish, which is fine. The
        likely destination suits me perfectly, and soon enough I am passing through
        security and entering the area of the Western Wall.</p>
    <p>There is a sign as I approach security explaining that I will be going through
        security and that the Rabbi High Council has determined that walking
        through the metal detector does not constitute a breech in Shabbat.
        Observant Jews are meant to refrain from all work on the Shabbat, even
        switching on a light switch. I also see a sign explaining that using a camera
        does count and could I please not use the camera here on the Shabbat. I
        politely oblige, slipping my camera back into my pocket. Not all experiences
        are for the camera. As I have said previously, many of the world wonders
        were less than mind blowing. The Western Wall does not disappoint.
        Standing there is a very powerful experience. The full gravity of where I am
        slowly filters through me: the Holiest of Holies. That is a real phrase, and it
        refers to a real place. A specific place. Here. Right here. Or more
        specifically, up there, on top of that wall, where the great Temple once
        stood. But all of that is a long story, for another time.</p>
    <p>I back away and return to the streets of Old Jerusalem. As I walk, I stumble,
        quite by chance, upon the Via Dolorosa. The path taken by Christ as he
        carried the cross to his death. Just a regular pedestrian street, with shops
        and stalls. A real place. I see a station of the Via Dolorosa. There are twelve
        different points of significance along the path and including the Crucifixion,
        and here is one of them. The breath from my lungs is gone. I feel completely
        overwhelmed. Not like India, with chaos and filth, but with …with wonder,
        and history. So much happened here. This city, it’s like nothing else in the
        world. Half the population of the planet are tied to this one square
        kilometer. I realize I am in way over my head. I can’t just wander aroundJerusalem like I would any other city. I few more surprises like that and I’ll
        have a heart attack.</p>
    <p>I sit with my phone and use some of my nearly spent overseas wireless data
        allowance. I’ve been careless and it may cost me, but I see this right now as
        essential. I look for a good walking tour, Jerusalem is a pedestrian
        experience, no cars, and find just the right thing. A tour today of the Mount
        of Olives and another tomorrow of the holy sites of the city. As it stands, the
        following day, Monday, I am scheduled for a day trip to Bethlehem (another
        thought that stuns me). That done, I take the remaining hours before
        today’s tour and walk outside of the city, around the walls that surround
        Jerusalem. Much of it is on the ground, but for fourteen shekels (around
        US$3.50), maybe a quarter of the walk is up on the ramparts, which is quite
        an experience. After the full circle, I grab a falafel pita and a Gatorade and
        go to meet my tour group.</p>
    <p>The tour assembles, perhaps a dozen of us, and by 1440 we are off. We take
        a minivan ride up onto the Mount of Olives, a hill just outside and to the
        east of the Old City, where Jesus and his disciples spent much of their time,
        now rich with various churches and a vast Jewish Cemetery. Our first stop
        is to the Chapel of the Ascension, now attached to a mosque. This spot,
        tradition states, is where Christ ascended bodily to Heaven. It was a
        Byzantine site once, then lost to the Muslims, who regard Jesus as a great
        prophet, and tended to place their own stamp on Christian sites rather than
        simply destroy them. It may also be worth mentioning that this is one of
        three ascension sites. It bears repeating that there was a significant lapse in
        time between the life of Christ and the open and public worship that led to
        churches and so forth. Some knowledge that we would all like to have kept
        undeniably got lost.</p>
    <p>We continue down the hill, soaking in some truly amazing views, and
        visiting some amazing churches.
        The Church of the Lord’s Prayer. The Garden of Gethsemane. The Tomb of
        Mary, mother of Christ. Pretty amazing.</p>
    <p>Head spinning, I walk back toward my hostel, stopping for a bite to eat. I sit
        down to a fantastic slice of pizza and a ginormous Greek salad as Tom &
        Jerry cartoons silently play on the TV and Amy Winehouse grooves through
        the stereo. It’s been quite a day. I can’t even think about tomorrow just yet.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
