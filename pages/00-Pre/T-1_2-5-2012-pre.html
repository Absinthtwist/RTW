    <h1>The Days Leading Up</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 15 November 2011</h2>
<p>    I’m going to try to get into the habit of making frequent posts here, though I’m not sure what all I will have to say.
    Still some months oﬀ from the big trip. My gear is more or less ready. The itinerary is just about locked. Things
    like train tickets and travel visas will have to wait, can’t be bought until I hit the 90 day window. I’m securing my
    hostel reservations and buying the odd plane ticket and feeling a bit frustrated by my bank. The big rtw (round
    the world) ticket upset my bank. Then all these little hostel deposits are now upsetting my bank. My card is yet
    again frozen. I get that it’s for my own security, but still. Annoying.
    Looking over my web site, I can see that I’m going to want pages for all of my destinations, past and future, and
    my current menu system feels inadequate. That will need to be addressed. Presumably I’ll need to buy a more
    complex site layout. There are thousands upon thousands of prefab websites, to say nothing of custom work.
    It’s a bit daunting.
    I’m about to head into work. The ER here is nice. Small, rural, not terribly challenging. I’ve decided that I enjoy
    the rural ERs much more. While it can be quite busy, there can also be a fair amount of downtime which I can
    use for reading. I have a book on India with me, hoping to get some ideas for Delhi and Kolkata, both
    overwhelming and intimidating destinations.
    Time’s up, I must be oﬀ to work.
    Ciao</p>

        Three and a half years ago, i set a goal. For my fortieth birthday, I want to backpack around the world. And here
I stand, tickets at the ready, waiting out the clock to start my journey.
</p>
<p>
So now is the question: what’s next? Nothing small, mind you. Only an impossible challenge will do. So here it
is, suﬃciently challenging, I believe, but with time enough to make it happen.
Ready:</p>
<blockquote>
    By the end of May 2022, the fiftieth anniversary of my birth, I shall reach the summit of Mount Everest, or perish
    in the attempt.
</blockquote> 
<p>
Nothing like a nice modest goal, something easy to build confidence ;)
Now pardon me, I have an entire life to rearrange.

<h1>Flow Charts</h1>
<h2><date>Wednesday, 16 November 2011</date></h2>
<p>
    So it occurs to me that I have a reasonable idea of where I am and where I want to be in ten years or less. I see
a flow chart where the box at the end shows a stick figure on a mountain waving and a box at the beginning
with a slug. So I would like to have a clear idea of what the steps are in between. Jogging certainly. Hiking.
Incline walking with a heavy pack. My pack for my big trip weighs in at 20lb so that seems great start. And diet
will be an entire chapter unto itself.
</p>
<p>
    I’ve been making a gradual change to a healthier diet, I am pleased to say, and I can keep moving that way.
More veggies. Less fast food. More veggies. Less sugar. More veggies. Bring a full stop to processed food.
And oh yeah, more veggies.
</p>
<p>
    I have a couple of really good vegetable cook books I recently picked up, and I’d like to pick up an Indian food
cookbook as well as a Thai cookbook.
</p>
<p>
    Flow chart could be a while oﬀ, but I have the next couple steps clear in mind. That’s enough.
</p>

    Back in Seattle. Thanksgiving went well enough, but I’m glad to be back in my own space. Seattle is growing on
me. Raining cats and dogs at the moment, but that’s ok, I don’t mind the rain, and I love all the green it brings.
</p>
<p>
    I bought my final fight tickets today. It was quite a feeling. Everything else is ferry or train or bus. The trains I can
buy online, but only within the 90 day window, if I have my facts straight. The buses and ferries will have to be
bought on site.
</p>
<p>
    The next step will be securing visas. Like the train tickets, these must be bought at the right time, not too early.
China, Cambodia, India, Jordan I think, Egypt, and perhaps Turkey. Not sure about Thailand, but it’s easy to
check.
</p>
<p>
    Travel insurance done. Travel vaccines done. Air tickets done. 104 days and counting. 2 more weeks and I can
start looking at those visas and train tickets. In the meantime, I should continue my process of reserving hostel
beds.
</p>
<p>
    This is my first 12 hour shift of 7 in a row. Not fun, but this is what I need to do. I shall try to keep posting during
downtime, but I may be gone for a bit.
Ciao

<h1>Awe and Wonder</h1>
<h2>

    I had an experience at work that, strangely, gave me a diﬀerent perspective on my coming journey. It gave me
no new information, it just reminded me. We had a patient come into the ER in active labor. Perhaps because it
is a potential positive where most of the car crashes and gun shots and heart attacks and strokes and unending
queue of crazies are all basically negative. Perhaps because every ER I have ever worked in has made every
eﬀort to shelter itself from such a patient as this. Whatever the reason, I was palpably aware, even amidst the
chaos, that I was standing on sacred ground. That something profound was occurring right before me. As it
turned out, our doctor jumped onto the ambulance with the patient and was able to race her to a more
appropriate venue for birth, but I got the message notwithstanding. I will be going to some very significant
places. Centers of great worship, places designed to create awe and wonder. And I wish to be open to those
experiences, open to the fullest. However: just a reminder: the Divine exists everywhere. In all places, at all
times. And awe can come from out of the blue. That sense of wonder comes from me being open and
accepting as much as from anything else. I will go to the great temples, but I may never have a more profound
experience than holding that woman’s hand, a woman i had never met, and will likely never encounter again.
</p>
<p>
    I do not look for awe, like a kid with a chip on his shoulder. I come open eyed, welcoming whatever experience
comes.

<h1>Seattle Tacoma International Airport</h1>

    At Seatac. Having an extended weekend with some old friends down in San Diego. I was able to get an hour’s
nap after work, then on my way to here. Truth told, I’m probably a little too early and perhaps as much as a
second hour of sleep could have been had, but I’ve learned a little basic prep goes a long way toward disaster
prevention. Chugged down a large mocha when I got here and my poor body just isn’t accustomed to coﬀee
drinking. Still, better awake and alert.
</p>
<p>
    I’m sitting at the gate now, looking out into the fog. Very few electrical outlets around, and I’m choosing the open
view over a full battery just now. My phone’s battery was at near full upon arrival, and that will suﬃce. I am
looking forward to seeing old friends and am hoping for some time to just relax. Been pushing hard to get
needed travel funds for my coming journey and feeling a little burnt out. Last thing I need is to head to my first
stop a frazzled mess.
</p>
<p>
    I’m using this trip as a dry run for my travel gear and pack. I had some doubts to some of the items in my pack,
namely my titanium spork, but got through no worries. Last check, the bag, an Osprey Porter 46, weighed in at
24lb with full load including my coat and day pack. I’d like to drop that by perhaps 2 or 3lb and weigh in at an
even 10kg to keep things simpler overseas. I have a lot of room to cut back right now.
</p>
<p>
    I’m loaded up with no less than 4 bars of soap, 30 feet of cord, odds and ends, even a small sized can opener.
All of this and more is up for review. I will review item by item when I return. For now, I shall enjoy watching the
planes taxi by, waiting for my flight. More later.
Ciao.

<h1>Thirty Days</h1>
<h2>
    Sunday,5 February 2012
</h2>
<p>
    Everyone is focused on the Super Bowl today, and good for them. For myself, I cannot help but find my mind
turned in a very diﬀerent direction. I am now one month and fourteen hours from my departure. There is a basic,
expected level of panic, of course. Did I forget anything, will my passport and travel visas make it back in time,
will I have enough money But also a sense of assuredness, that I have pretty much done all that I can do, time
to sit back and let it unfold. In the end, planning will only get you so far, its how you respond in the face of reality,
when all the plans fail.
</p>
<p>
    I have cleared out most of the clutter in my life in preparation of this trip. Cancelled all unnecessary expenses,
that sort of thing. My meager room has been nearly emptied, the rest will stay with me till I leave. My bag is
packed, though I keep reshuﬄing the contents for the most eﬃcient packing. There are only a couple things I am
on the fence about: should I, for example, bring a long sleeve tee shirt? It may be cold that first month and I
have brought little in the way of warmth, seeing how most of my trip will be damned hot. Secondly, I find I am
more than a little self-conscious of the tattoo on my arm, being in Japanese, going into China and Japan.
I experimented with eye-fi technology to see if that was what I was looking for but have pretty much concluded
that it is not. So pictures taken on my phone are likely to stay right there on my phone for the duration of the trip,
while pics taken on my iphone will be uploaded and shared as I go. The complication is that I have limited room
on the iphone and have not yet decided on the best way to upload pics en mass while on the road. A couple
here and there to Facebook or here is fine, but not all of them.
</p>
<p>
    One of the big anxiety areas is the question of what have I forgotten? Did I remember everything? Fly into Hong
Kong, buy a rail pass, take the airport train to the central station, then the blue line to… There’s a line between
being careless and over-planning. Its a subjective, personal thing, and I think I’m right right where I need to be. I
have a general idea how to get from the airports to the hostels and back, a general idea of some of the things
I’d like to see. I have some stuﬀ reserved and pre-paid, other things I’ll just have to wing it on site. The other big
anxiety is cash: have I miscalculated or misunderstood how much cash would be needed? again, that’s a
bridge I’ll just have to cross then. Hopefully, I won’t be flying home in 3 weeks out of funds.
</p>
<p>
    Not really sure what else to say, everything feels incomplete to me just now. Thirty days and counting down.
