    <h1>The Days Leading Up</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 15 November 2011</h2>
<p>    I’m going to try to get into the habit of making frequent posts here, though I’m not sure what all I will have to say.
    Still some months oﬀ from the big trip. My gear is more or less ready. The itinerary is just about locked. Things
    like train tickets and travel visas will have to wait, can’t be bought until I hit the 90 day window. I’m securing my
    hostel reservations and buying the odd plane ticket and feeling a bit frustrated by my bank. The big rtw (round
    the world) ticket upset my bank. Then all these little hostel deposits are now upsetting my bank. My card is yet
    again frozen. I get that it’s for my own security, but still. Annoying.
    Looking over my web site, I can see that I’m going to want pages for all of my destinations, past and future, and
    my current menu system feels inadequate. That will need to be addressed. Presumably I’ll need to buy a more
    complex site layout. There are thousands upon thousands of prefab websites, to say nothing of custom work.
    It’s a bit daunting.
    I’m about to head into work. The ER here is nice. Small, rural, not terribly challenging. I’ve decided that I enjoy
    the rural ERs much more. While it can be quite busy, there can also be a fair amount of downtime which I can
    use for reading. I have a book on India with me, hoping to get some ideas for Delhi and Kolkata, both
    overwhelming and intimidating destinations.
    Time’s up, I must be oﬀ to work.
    Ciao</p>
