    <h1>Day 16: Tokyo Disneyland</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 22 March 2012</h2>
<h3>Tokyo, Japan</h3>
<p>    A travel day. My flight leaves at 0840 and the nice folks at my hostel
    insisted that I should leave leave in plenty of time, four hours before my
    flight. Knowing what I kn3w of Beijing traffic I can see their point, but at0400 the roads were bare. So here I am well before take-off, well before
    even check-in, and nothing for it but to wait.</p>
    <p>
        Slept in and took our time, made it out the door by 1000. We took our time,
stopped for breakfast, got a little lost with the metro trains, but made it into
Disneyland by noon.
There are two parks here, Disneyland and Disney Sea.
We decided to focus on Disneyland, though Disney Sea looked a lot cooler
than it initially sounded. A giant volcano towers as their centerpiece, and it
looks like they have both the submarine ride and the Indiana Jones ride
over there. Alas, would probably have been cool.
    </p>
<p>
    On the way to the Disneyland park we were seduced by the beauty of the
Disneyland Hotel, and we began to hatch a very irresponsible and luxurious
plan. We looked into getting a room at the Disneyland Hotel, despite the
ludicrous price, but had no luck. Either they were out of room or it was a
communication problem, hard to tell. The Japanese people are so obsessed
with being polite that they won’t tell you no even when appropriate, they
won’t even tell you they don’t understand you. It can be a little frustrating,
but their courtesy is still impressive.
</p>
<p>So after that delay, we went into the park itself. As discussed before, I’m
    quite familiar with the original Disneyland, and am acutely aware of every
    similarity and difference.Instead of Main Street USA you have the World Bazaar, which was nearly
    identical to Main Street. Two immediate differences: first, the whole street
    is covered over, giving a sort of Art Nouveau World Expo kinda feel. Then
    second is the absence of a train. I did find a Disneyland Railroad in
    Adventure Land, that did its own self contained loop with no stops, but no
    train station, no tunnels to pass through under the tracks.</p>
    <p>
        While the park was quite large, transitions from one land to another often
seemed quite sudden and unexpected. World Bazaar would quickly turn
into Adventure Land which quickly melted into Western Land.
    </p>
<p>This Being a cloudy weekday, I think we both were caught off guard by the
    large crowds. Our first ride, after walking around for a bit, was the Haunted
    Mansion, with a two hour wait.</p>
<p>Very similar to the California original, with the amusing exception of the
    Japanese language. Hearing Donald Duck or Winnie the Pooh talk in
    Japanese is quite entertaining.
    At this point, we both agreed that we wanted to take our time and Linda
    was willing to be insanely extravagant and pay for a room. After making
    some inquiries, we secured a reservation. Not at the Disneyland Hotel, but
    at the slightly less expensive but still Disney Ambassador Hotel, which had
    a wonderful, elegant Art Deco motif.</p>
<p>I took one look at the swimming pool and couldn’t help but imagine Fred
    Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing across the steps. We settled into our
    room, relaxed a bit, then went back into Disneyland for more fun.
    I was surprised and pleased to discover that the old retired Disneyland
    classic the (Main Street) Electrical Parade is alive and well in Tokyo, both
    with classic floats like Pete’s Dragon
    and new magic like Mike and Sully!</p>
<p>We played into the night, staying late enough for fireworks, but early
    enough to make in back to our room for our 90 minute professional
    massages. Very luxurious, not cheap. I am living so modestly for the rest of
    the trip, I kinda just said “Fuck It.” A Comfy bed, a fantastic shower, it was
    wonderful.
    The massage finished, we both slept like rocks.Safe Journey….. zzzz</p>
