    <h1>Day 14: The Train To Tokyo </h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 20 March 2012</h2>
<h3>transition from Kyoto to Tokyo, Japan</h3>
<h4>1020</h4>
<p> Shinkansen speed train from Kyoto to Tokyo. As it pulled up to the
    station, gotta say, the train looked way sexy. Only three cars for unreserved
    passengers, and it is a bit crowded. But they are nice enough to provide
    electricity, so I’m charging as I type.</p>
    <p>The train pulled in to Tokyo around 1300 at Ueno Park. I made the half-
        mile walk to my hotel eventually, after winding my way through park and
        through markets, and after putting coins into the bowl of a monk (right out
        of a Kurosawa film, that guy).</p>
<p>
    I took my time in the hotel. Learning that if your plan is to travel for three
months, you can’t sprint the whole way like you can for a two week holiday.
And as my next goal was to see some city lights, I was waiting for the sun to
set anyway. So I decompressed, semi-napped, and watched some sumo
wrestling on tv.
</p>
<p>
    At around 1700, the sun not down but working on it, I set out for the Geek
Mecca of the known universe: Akihabara. Where computer hardware, video
games, anime, and scantily clad young girls all intersect. Looking to build
your own PC? This is the place. Motherboards, cases, fans, processors, the
works. Used laptop? No problem. Want to play a classic arcade game? This
is the place. I wandered through several different buildings, packed with
people playing all sorts of arcade games. It felt like time travel. Entire
floors. First floor, grab a toy with a crane games. Second floor, classic
arcade games. Saw a guy playing Donkey Kong. Another floor up, fighting
games of every sort. Next floor, shooter games. Next floor multiplayer
paradise. You get the idea. Several different entire buildings if this. There
was also a great deal of anime, and anime stuff: posters, books, and lots and
lots of action figures. Gotta say, the line between anime and porn got really
blurry. Plus, there were these young girls passing out different fliers,dressed in skimpy sexed out maids’ consumes, school girl outfits. Really
pushing the whole Lolita thing. Saw one girl handing out fliers, dressed in
the sexy school-girl look holding a big teddy bear. Don’t mind saying it
creeped me out a wee bit. One girl handed me a flier for a vampire bar. I
wanted to ask her how vampire tasted, but doubted her limited English
would help her get my already obscure humor and let it go.
</p>
<p>
    Feeling adequately geeked out, I hopped a train and moved on to the
Shinjuku district, one of the brightly lit hubs of the city. They have the
karaoke booths here, where you and a few friends go into a private room to
drink and eat and sing. The idea of singing in front of the whole bar
American style seems rare here. Lots of shopping and restaurants here. And
go a little further and you come to the red-light district. Remember, in
Japan, prostitution is legal- mostly. Everything a man and woman can do,
except actual coitus, is legal. On several occasions I would be approached,
each time by a different person but in each case a very large black man with
an African accent offering to show me where the girls are. My interest here
stops right about where my concern for things like human trafficking kicks
in. That really isn’t my scene, so I backed out of that area and headed back
for the night.
</p>
<p>
    Took the train back to my own much quieter neighborhood, grabbed a
quick bite to eat, kebabs, and by midnight am in bed. Tomorrow I see the
town, and in the evening, my dear friend Linda will be coming.
Safe journey.
