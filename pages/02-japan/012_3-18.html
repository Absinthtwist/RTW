    <h1>Day Twelve: Relaxed</h1>
    <h2>Sunday 18 March 2012</h2>
<h3>Kyoto, Japan</h3>
<h4>1200: Starbucks</h4>
<p>    Slow start today, more relaxed. Took a long shower, walked to the main rail
    station and picked up my Japan Rail pass. Japan is one of my more
    expensive stops, and, owing to ATM withdrawal limits, I was not able to
    pull out all the cash I would need here. No big, right? Well, as it turns out,
    few, and I mean very few ATMs in Japan accept American debit cards. So
    today I am questing for the right machine. It’s a bit of a project, and just
    now I am stopping for a relaxing beverage. And of course, my favorite sport,
    people watching. More later.</p>
    <h4>1915</h4>
    <p>Bit of a relaxed day today. Went on a quest for an ATM, resolved. Turns out
        post offices here have what I was looking for. Who knew.
        I went back into the train station, figuring I’d ride out to Arashiyama, but
        Sunday, even in Japan, means limited service. After waiting a bit with no
        luck, I decided to try another train. I had my Japan Rail pass and was
        curious to take a ride. I considered taking the train to Nara a day early, but
        on the last minute I grabbed a mystery train before it pulled from the
        station. I spent about 40 minutes riding through the town before getting off
        the train and heading back. At a point more or less near my hostel I got off
        the train and started walking. Sometimes people ask what I did or saw
        today, and it’s moments like this that are so very rewarding, but hard to
        explain. I just wandered around. Not exactly lost, you can’t really be lost
        with GPS in your pocket, but I certainly had no idea where I was. Traveling
        like this lets you discover the unexpected, and more important, you soak up
        the feel of a place. I ended up strolling through the Gion district, the old
        Kyoto, and to the Yasaka Jinja temple, which is the temple I was at last
        night, full of life and food stalls. I grabbed some chicken tempura and went
        to Gion Corner for a show demonstrating classical Japanese culture
        including the tea ceremony, flower arrangement, dance, and an interesting
        version of puppets. The dancing in particular was beautiful, with Geishas in
        full regalia. Graceful, elegant, feminine, beautiful.
        I made it back to the hostel to charge up the batteries and to continue the
        never ending quest to upload my photos. Today was a landmark: I finally
        finished uploading my China pictures. Soon I should be able to upload pics
        to the website.
        Off to bed now.
        Safe journey.
