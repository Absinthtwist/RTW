    <h1>Day 17: More Disneyland and Shibuya</h1>
    <h2>Friday 23 March 2012</h2>
<h3>Tokyo, Japan</h3>
<p>    A travel day. My flight leaves at 0840 and the nice folks at my hostel
    insisted that I should leave leave in plenty of time, four hours before my
    flight. Knowing what I kn3w of Beijing traffic I can see their point, but at0400 the roads were bare. So here I am well before take-off, well before
    even check-in, and nothing for it but to wait.</p>
<p>While we wanted to continue our theme of luxury and decadence, staying in
    the hotel earned us a pass into the park fifteen minutes earlier, so that was
    hard to say no to. To that end, we woke early and had room service
    delivered. Very posh having the room service, but the food was kinda bad.
    Japanese people mean really well when they try to cook western food, but
    more often than not its a fail. Pancakes and an omelette with bacon, all
    pretty off. But still, rolled into our room. Very cool.
    Alas, our plan to get into the park early didn’t quite work, checking out of
    the hotel took longer than expected. Further, we asked at the desk if they
    were able to mail packages to the States, and like I said before, the
    Japanese hate saying no or saying that they don’t understand, so we killed a
    lot of time waiting before we gave up and headed into the park.</p>
<p>Even at opening time the crowd was crazy. And fanatical: they were
    running, many of them full speed. You’d think that someone was gonna
    loose the dogs or something. At first this seemed crazy, but when I saw the
    line for Thunder Mountain, a quarter of a mile away from the ride, never
    mind all the ropes and switchbacks, I was stunned. We moved on to Splash
    Mountain.</p>
<p>With some patience and the use of Fastpass, we got in the rides we most
    wanted to see. We did have to let a few go. It was stunning to see two hour
    plus lines for some rides, then fifteen minute waits for rides like Star Tours
    and Pirates of the Caribbean.</p>
    <p>Linda commented, and rightly I think, how animatronics, state of the art
        1965, just no longer impresses, especially here in Japan. I would have
        thought that name value alone would keep these rides busy, but apparently
        not.</p>
<p>By about 1500 we knew we had done out best and had to look forward.
    Tomorrow we had to fly to Cambodia and did not wish to carry more thanwe had to with us. Few post offices were open at this hour, and there would
    be no time in the morning. So armed with that knowledge, we gathered
    ourselves up, said our good-byes to the Magic Kingdom and rode back into
    Tokyo, to the Shibuya.</p>
<p>The Shibuya might be compared to New York’s Times Square, full of lights
    and action at any hour, and a post office open into the night. We made our
    way through the rain and sent our packages off and took our time heading
    back to the train station and back to the hotel.</p>
<p>At the hotel, we did one load of laundry, packed ourselves up for the coming
    day, then fell into the best sleep manageable on such a hard bed. And really,
    aside from that high priced Ambassador Hotel, this bed is the softest I’ve
    had since leaving the states.
    Oh well. Here’s to hoping good things for Cambodia.
    Safe journey!</p>
