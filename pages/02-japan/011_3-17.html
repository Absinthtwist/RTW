    <h1>Day Eleven: Kyoto </h1>
    <h2>Saturday 17 March 2012</h2>
<h3>Kyoto, Japan</h3>
<p>    I am loving Japan. This city has such a wonderful sense of its own history.
Go hundreds of years, Kyoto was the capital of Japan. It was here that the
Emperor lived, and the Shogun. In the late 19th century the Emperor
relocated to Tokyo, and a lot of the action seemed to go that way too, but
Kyoto is very well regarded in Japan (or so I read), the center of Japanese
culture and heritage.</p>
<p>    I was up and out the door by 0800 this morning, into a chilling gray rain.
    The streets were still sparse at this hour, with few shops open. I found a
    veryinteresting covered market area, though it was just setting up and not yet
    open. I took a break at a Starbucks to coffee up and dry off and enjoyed a
    very  pleasant view before moving on to the truly fabulous Nijo Castle. This place
    was gorgeous. After coming from China, where irreplaceable world heritage
    sites are look sooty and
    forgotten, this was a breath of very fresh air. Going into the main building,
    everyone had to take their shoes off. I made a point of coming here early,
    but still it was quite crowded. I can only imagine how packed this would be
    on a sunny summer school day. And I can
    only further imagine how amazingly cool this place would be without the
    crowd, walking these old halls. However, here we all go, in our socks (no
    shoes allowed) onto those famous nightingale floors. For those unfamiliar,
    these wooden floors were crafted in such a way that no foot, however light,
    could sneak through these halls
    undetected. Each step produced that particular bird-like chirp-squeak as we
    walked from room to gorgeous room. No photography whatever. Tatami
    floor mats, sliding wall panels, wall decorations of pine trees and tigers,
    rooms for the Shogun to greet formal guests, private rooms, many
    chambers. Them out into the back of the complex to the garden. This whole
    place has a stout wall surrounded by a pristine moat. Large carp and ducks
    are in residence. China’s moats were… less wholesome.
    I also enjoyed a detour of a Japanese tea ceremony. I was led, shoeless,
    onto an open porch area and had a seat on the floor.
</p>
<p>
    A young woman in a kimono walked gracefully over and kneeled in front of
    me and placed a small dish on the floor before me. On the dish was about
    an inch or inch and a half neatly formed ball of what looked like tea-green
    play-do, with a small bamboo knife. Then away she went, and a moment
    later came back with a bowl, half-filled with a green frothy liquid. Tea. Turns out the play-do is mildly sweet, and is given to balance out the
    natural bitterness of the tea. I took my time, enjoyed my beautiful
    surroundings, enjoyed my tea, then was back on my way.
</p>
<p>
    From here I was heading toward the Imperial Palace Park, and on the way
    was the International Manga Museum, which Lonely Planet said was worth
    a look. I wouldn’t exactly call myself a fan, but manga certainly has been
    influential. It was interesting, but it was really a niche thing. I think I was
    there for maybe thirty minutes. For a museum junkie like me, that was
    really brief.
</p>
<p>
    The imperial Palace Park was very lovely, the Palace itself is of limited
access, so I gave it s pass. I decided to make the long walk to Silver Pavilion,
rightly called Ginkakuji Temple. The walk was not short, and it was about
1500 by this point, so I decided to grab some lunch. I stepped into a likely
looking establishment, something simple and reasonable looking, which
pictures of appealing looking food in the window. Inside it was rather quiet.
Maybe two or three other people seated. It had the generic look of a diner: a
few booths, a long curving counter. I sat at the counter. The waitress lady
directed me to an unlikely looking vending machine in the corner. It was here that one placed the order. I inserted a coin, comparable to
around four or five US dollars and made a selection as best I could. Out
popped a ticket which I handed to the waitress, and had a seat, a cup of
green tea already waiting for me. A few moments later out came my lunch,
some sort of meat over rice and a bowl of miso soup. Quite enjoyable.
It still feels a bit odd walking out without leaving a tip, but that’s the way
Japan goes. From there I went next door to a very colorful drug store and
bought a pack of peppermint-lemon mints. They were … interesting.

</p>
<p>
    Ginkakuji Temple. Once again I am struck by the irony of being in such an
    amazingly beautiful and peaceful place while surrounded elbow to elbow by
    crowds of tourists. The temple itself was pretty, and the audio guide
    explained how much of a significant impact it has had on Japanese
    architecture, but for me, the magic of this place was not the building, but
    the calming, beautiful grounds.
</p>
<p>
    The path south from the temple grounds led alongside a very old a lovely
    tree-lined canal, an area known as the Philosopher’s Walk. I made my way
    unhurriedly down this road as the sun slowly sunk to the west.
    I stepped from the path heading west, past a temple, closed for the day.
    Beautiful to look at, I do not know the name.My walk led me to the Gion District, the area of Kyoto which has best
    preserved and in some places recaptured the look of its past. Old streets,
    old buildings. The occasional ladies walking by in kimonos (though none in
    geisha makeup). In the midst of this I found a bright orange temple,
    thronging with an energetic crowd. Closer inspection revealed a scene less
    like a temple and more like a county fair. Lively people, food stalls
    everywhere. Taking the plunge, I went for the most interesting thing I could
    find (though perhaps not the most appealing). Octopus balls. A metal tray
    similar in shape to an egg carton, each bowl partially filled with coarsely
    chopped octopus bits. A batter is then poured, filling the bowls, heat is
    applied. I ordered the smallest order possible, six balls. The vendor put
    them in a plastic tray, smeared a layer of what I think was barbecue sauce
    and some unknown garnish, like bits of soft onion paper. The result was
    interesting, but not exactly a new passion for me. Hot and firm on the
    outside. The dough still overly creamy on the inside, and the octopus, as
    one would imagine, was rubbery. I ate four and felt I was done. I went into
    the nearest quick-mart and purchased some pocky. I know they can be
    found in the US by those who look hard enough, but they make me smile. I
    finished my walk though the magical Gion and returned to my hostel for the
    night.
</p>
<p>
    Tomorrow I hope to see the Golden Pavilion, and even more, I hope to see
    the Arashiyama district, though it is quite out of the way.
    I’m pretty beat and am heading to bed. Safe journey.
