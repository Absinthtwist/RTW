    <h1>Day 15: Tokyo!</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 21 March 2012</h2>
<h3>Tokyo, Japan</h3>
<p>Was out the door by around 0930 or so, took a detour to the post office to
    ship some stuff back. Cheaper than I had feared, but about as slow as I
    imagined. It was equal to around $35 US for a box around 10x12x18 inches
    or so, and should take one to two months. Naturally, I went for cheap
    rather than fast, and it should still get home faster than I will.</p>
    <p>
        From there I grabbed the train to the Ginza, the center of Tokyo, filled with
high end shops. But I went right past that and headed for the Tsukiji
market district. This, my friends, is the world famous fish market with the
tuna auctions. I looked into watching the auctions, I even considered
waking pre-dawn to be here for the 0500 auction,but it appears that they are a shy bunch, these fishmongers, and
reservations are required. Having discovered that, I naturally slept in. Well,
I may not have been able to witness the auction, but I bet I could
have seen more if I’d gotten there before 1100. Ah, well, it was still quite
amazing. From there I wandered through the Ginza, peeking into the
various stores, had a walk through the display lobby of the Sony Building,
the obligatory Apple store check (I was/still am seriously tempted to buy a
MacBook Air with Japanese/English keyboard). Curious to note that not a
single building there appears to be taller than twenty stories.
I wandered and came to the most amazing toy store, four stories of hello-
kitties, gundam robots and other fun peculiarities, including an entire
section of figurines a d plush toys from the works of Hayao Miazaki.
Way cool. My favorite part was their little Star Wars section, with light-
saber umbrellas, light-saber chopsticks, and coolest of all, the dark lord of
the sith himself, in samurai form, Vader-San!
    </p>
    <p>
        From here I took my standard Starbucks break to catch my breath, people-
watch, and plot my next move.
I took the train to Ueno Park. When the Japanese Emperor brought an end
to the Samurai class, this is where the last of them made their stand and
died.
    </p>
<p>
    This park is their memorial, and it’s quite nice. Oh, and if you haven’t seen
    the film the Last Samurai I highly recommend that you do. It’s amazing,
    and inspired (very loosely) by real events. Aside from being a lovely park in
    its own right, it also contains a shrine, a zoo, and at least three museums
    that I counted. As the afternoon was wearing down, I passed the natural
    science museum and the western art museum and went straight for the Tokyo National Museum. It
    was fabulous. Buddha statues, kimonos, samurai swords. Elegantly painted
    room dividers, paintings. It was quite a treat. From there I wandered in a
    pleasantly vague and lost way through the labyrinthine Ueno Station before
    heading back to my room to chill for a bit.
</p>
<p>
    I finally got wild and rode back to the Ginza to see about buying that
    MacBook Air, but my credit card didn’t feel like making that large apurchase, so far from home. Frustrating, but I suppose some security is a
    good thing. I will add that as cool as the Ginza and Tokyo as a whole is
    during the day, my advise to fellow travelers would be to just sleep in:
    Tokyo is FAR more impressive after dark.
</p>
<p>
    So now I am back in Ueno Station, eating some seriously craved American
    food -nachos – while I patiently wait for my dear friend Linda to join me.
</p>
<p>
    I had a wonderful dinner with Linda, then we walked and talked well into
the night. Tomorrow, Disneyland!
</p>
<p>
    Keeping my eyes peeled for Godzilla!
