    <h1>Day 18: Tokyo to Siem Reap</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 24 March 2012</h2>
<h3>Tokyo, Japan to Siem Reap, Cambodia</h3>
<p>  A reasonably early start and to the train station, a mix-up with the trains
    leading to a much longer ride to the airport, but we made it intact. Not so
    intact through the airport, however. Linda and I start and end our day in
    the same places, from Tokyo to Siem Reap, and at more or less the same
    time, but we take different flights, transferring in different cities. So while a
    parting of the ways was expected, it happened in a manner unexpected. I,
    with my tourist visa, went right through customs and on my way. Linda,
    however, residing and working in Japan, got help at immigration.
    Presumably there were unexpected forms for her to work through then she
    would be on her way and we would meet up again on the other side. I can’t
    say for certain. She waved at me and waved me on my way. I do hope to see
    her when my plane lands in Cambodia, but I cannot say for certain.
    Good luck, Linda!</p>
    <h2>1840 Busan International Airport</h2>
    <p>
        I’ve taken my seat in my plane. At five and a half hours, this will be the
third longest flight of my trip, with Reykjavik-Boston taking second place
after my Hong Kong flight. I have a good book with me (Hunger Games,
finished American Gods in Beijing), and am more or less ready. Window
seat, no one next to me yet, fingers crossed.
    </p>
<p>
    I have removed my jacket and mentally and physically tucked it away. It’s
been cold thus far, but I am about to make a transition both in temperature
and temperament. This will be the tropics, in the third world. Quite
different.
</p>
<p>
    On the health front, I’ve had a bit of sniffles since Xi’an, and I feel generally
worn out. I need a couple of light days and a couple of days off, and
thankfully, they are coming. My left foot typically gives me trouble, being
slightly larger and more flat, but in a bit of a surprise my right foot has been
the problem child thus far. Given the nature of the pain, my own
professional medical opinion is that I have a very mild fracture. Nothing
traumatic has happened, probably just the walking. It’s painful, but nothing
serious. Nothing requiring a cast or any of that. Just a few light days and on
I go. The shoes I wear are solid and make all the difference.
</p>
<p>The plane is in the air and mostly empty. The two seats next to me and the
    entire row behind me are empty. And in front of me is the partition
    separating coach from first. So I have some space. That’s good. Right now
    I’m enjoying reading, but I may choose to sleep later.
    I moved back a row and took the isle, more room for long legs. Meal choices
    were chicken, beef, or eel. I went with chicken. I eat what food is given on
    the plane, mostly, but figure if I want to experiment, airplane food is hardly
    a fair sample. Also of note, while U.S. domestic flights seem to have stopped
    giving out peanuts, Asia seems less concerned with food allergies.
    On a side note, I had heard many times that the Japanese people were
    profoundly courteous and that they seem to place grace and excellence into
    everything they do. Those rumors all appear true insofar as my experience
    from this trip. I always felt safe, everything was clean, and everything was
    done with elegance, down to the way they would put purchased items in a
    bag then hand you your receipt. When I bought my book, the cashier, rather
    than placing my book into a bag, made me a brown paper book cover.
    That’s just classy. Of course, one gets the impression sometimes that they
    lack initiative or imagination. They seem to seldom come up with a new
    idea of their own, but they always seem to take what they are given and
    improve it. I enjoyed Japan immensely. More than China, I would say.
    Though Hong Kong is in a class by itself.</p>
    <p>Landed in Cambodia on time around 2300, made it through immigration,
        etc and thankfully Linda was right there waiting for me. And as we left the
        airport, our ride to our hotel was also waiting for us. We were driven
        through the night in a motorcycle tuk-tuk into town, past many very
        luxurious looking resorts until we came to our rather modest
        accommodations. Simple, but more than enough, and for my money, the
        most comfortable bed yet on this adventure. We’ve turned on the AC and
        the ceiling fans and are looking forward to sleeping in.</p>
        <p>Safe journey!</p>
