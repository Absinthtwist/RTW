    <h1>Day 13: Nara</h1>
    <!-- <h2>Monday 19 March 2012</h2> -->
<h3>Nara, Japan</h3>
<!-- <h4>0430</h4> -->
<p>   Today I go to Nara.
    Nara is about an hour’s train ride from Kyoto, not too bad. And from there
    perhaps a mile walk to Nara Park. There’s a local myth of some God coming
    in riding a deer, so as a result deer are considered messengers of the godsand protected. There must be hundreds of deer just hanging out through
    the very large park.</p>
    <p>
        Vendors sell biscuits for tourists to pass around to the deer, and the deer
        are most insistent about wanting to be fed. They are completely unafraid of
        humans, seem to see us as food dispensers, and they walk right up to you.
        They have no problem with you walking up and touching them, petting
        them, whatever, so long as there is food involved. And they don’t mind
        following you, nudging you, bullying you for the food they know is coming.
        Thankfully, all their antlers have been filed down to a nub. Again, hundreds
        of deer. Crazy.

        There are a great many temples here in Nara, including one of the tallest
        pagodas in Japan,
        but the most noteworthy item is the giant Buddha. One of the largest
        Buddha statues anywhere, and the centerpiece for a magnificent temple.
        For my money, this was more beautiful than anything in China, including
        the Forbidden City.
        There were also a couple of small but gorgeous museums in Nara Park,
        beautifully done. Sorry, no photography allowed in either.
        Once I’d had my fill of these beautiful temples and hyper-aggressive deer
        (one kept biting at my pants to express himself and his desire for my food),
        it was back on the train and back to my neighborhood. I stopped to grab
        some food, and again, no idea what the name of the place was, but it was
        good. I think it was some sort of Mongolian Grill. The dish I ate was called a
        Gengis Kahn. I was seated at a bar/counter, which was all there was of this
        place. And before be below the counter was what looked like a crock pot,
        but was actually a small wood stove.

    <p>
        Loaded with fuel and covered with a convex grilling surface, a square inch
        church of animal fat was placed at top center and allowed to grease the
        cooking surface. Then the food was added: onions, peppers, pumpkin and
        carrots, tons of bean sprouts, and chunks of lamb meat. I was given a bowl
        of brown liquid, it reminded me in appearance to Chinese hoisin peanut
        sauce, but no peanut flavor.
    </p>
<p>
    Once the food was adequately grilled, you would use chopsticks to grab a
bit, dip it in the brown sauce then eat. Quite good, actually. Every now and
then the waitress would come over with her tongs and redistribute the foodto keep it warm evenly and closer to me to grab. Washed down with a
Japanese beer, all around enjoyable.
In the morning, I’m off to Tokyo!
Safe journey.
