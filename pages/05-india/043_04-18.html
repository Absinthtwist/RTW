    <h1>Day 43: Jaipur</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 18 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Jaipur, India</h3>
    <p>Feeling better today, I’m out and in the road with my driver by 0900.
        Having a car with AC is quite a change. I’m pretty tired and really didn’t
        want to get out of bed, but I’d say the sickness is 90% out of me.</p>
    <p>Our first stop is the Albert Hall. Always plenty of Victorian references in
        India, it would appear. It’s a pretty good museum inside an absolutely
        beautiful building.</p>
    <p>After exploring Albert Hall a bit, I return to my driver and we enter Old
        Jaipur, the Pink City. We make a photo stop at the Palace of Winds, which
        is gorgeous, but I decline to explore further. It’s really a pretty facade on
        nothing particularly interesting anymore. The building has an appearance
        hard to explain. An organic, almost underwater look to it, in pink stone.
        The story goes that the ladies at court were not permitted in the streets,
        could not be looked at by men, and this facade was constructed to allow
        them to observe city life without being seen. It’s quite unlike anything else I
        can think of.</p>
    <p>We drive on and come to the Jantar Mantar, the 18th century astronomy
        observatory. No, not a single telescope on these lovely grounds, just the
        most amazing, dreamlike, unanticipated geometric shapes, rising in stone
        into the air. Great triangles, thirty feet tall. Other shapes I won’t begin to tryto escape. It’s like a geometry teacher having a dream. They would use these
        various constructions for precise measurements of constellations and stars.
        It’s amazing.</p>
    <p>I cross the street to the City Palace, still the property of the local Maharaja.
        I was not aware the maharajas still existed, but apparently they do. A sort of
        county or state Prince. The grounds are nice, but not astounding.</p>
    <p>From here we drive north, starting to get further from the city center. The
        heat is really starting in full glory. We stop at Maharaja Tombs, which are
        all but deserted. My primary competitors for space here are the pigeons.
        There are several very beautiful and intricate buildings, all open air. The
        seem more like oversized beautiful gazebos, and I can find no indication of
        any tomb-iness but I don’t make a case of it. The gazebos soon become
        redundant, and soon I am ready to move on.</p>
    <p>At this point, the sun is at its full power and we stop for lunch. I’m still a
        little unsure about my stomach but can’t fear eating forever, so I try to take
        it easy and just order some garlic nan and some mutton biriani. Truly
        delicious, and while my stomach was still a little uncomfortable, on the
        whole I felt much improved with some food in my belly.</p>
    <p>We make a stop in a textile workshop, where a man there, with profound
        hospitality and graciousness, happily walked me through his workshop. He
        showed me where they boiled the dyes, all vegetable dyes, no chemicals. I
        was stunned to see such a deep green produced from spinach. And how the
        cloth was first washed and rinsed, then run through the dye. From there it
        is allowed to dry in the sun, then to saltwater, then to the sun again, a forty-
        eight hour process. From there he showed me a loom where a man was in
        the process of making a beautifully elegant carpet. His hands moved with
        stunning speed, a single thread at a time. From there, I was shown the
        block printing process, which is rather universal, and explained its use on
        cloth, sometimes just a single block (color), sometimes as many as nine.
        From here I was lead upstairs to what could only be called the sales floor.
        I’d love to say I’ve become a little more accustomed to this sort of thing, and
        I think I have, but truly, my sense of ease had far more to do with the
        hospitality and service offered. If Americans were expected to give this level
        of service and be genuine and friendly and not obsequious as this man
        displayed…well, I won’t be looking for it.</p>
    <p>Explaining up front that this was his job, this was his pleasure, and that I
        was absolutely and in no way obliged to buy a thing, he proceeded to show
        me different cloths at different qualities. We took our time, he answered my
        questions, we looked at other things similar to what I was liking. All very
        enjoyable. And good business practice, too. I spent money, of course.
        Including shipping home of that package, I’ll have you know I am still
        within my budget.</p>
    <p>From here we make the bigger drive, and really, it’s not so bad as all that, to
        Amber Fort. Around four hundred years old, Amber Fort is more accurately
        called a castle, at least in my estimations, and quite a good one too. I’m no
        castle expert, only having visited two thus far I can remember, and one in
        ruins, but this sure seems to fit the bill. My other castle and measure of
        comparison would be the Tower of London, which is a truly amazing site
        and has mysteries and marvels of its own, and it’s hard to compare these
        two. Amber Fort certainly seems the larger, and perched high on a hilltop
        away from the city, probably harder to take. But then, the Tower was made
        to rule and be present.</p>
    <p>I wander about, admiring lovely bits of decorations here and there, a
        beautifully carved windscreen, so many rooms, seeming to go on and on.
        Through a small air shaft leading behind a staircase, to some unreachable
        room, I can see a cluster of hanging bats. Filled with much elegance, this
        makes the Maharaja’s current digs in town and the City Palace I saw look
        even less impressive, but somehow I think he’s got himself a truly fine
        home somewhere, not on any tourist’s map.</p>
    <p>Just about fully cooked, we head back to my hotel, pausing once for a quick
        picture of the Water Palace, which is, as it sounds, a palace appearing out of
        the water in the middle of a lake. I give my driver a generous tip and my
        hearty thanks, and head in. I pretty much have a relaxed and boring night
        after that, and about ready to turn in, when at around 2200, I hear a loud
        pop, like.. well, just like a gunshot. I figure it’s a firecracker or a car backfire
        or whatever. And then I hear it again. Then I hear it a lot. Well, unsure if
        this is the Indian New Year or the start of the revolution, I step out of my
        room and see a rocking party about a block away, with all sorts of colors
        and lights. Another guest, an Indian gentleman, has also come out to see,
        and tells me this is a wedding. I hate to let all my fans down, but assured
        that the people are not rising up, I go to bed. I can be the party animal
        another time.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
