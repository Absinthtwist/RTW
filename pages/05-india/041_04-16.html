    <h1>Day 41: Khajuraho</h1>
    <h2>Monday 16 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Khajuraho, India</h3>
    <p>Yesterday my diet included one bottle of sprite, two bananas and a great
        deal of bottled water. The toilet and I became dear friends by the end, I’ll
        leave it at that. The train ride was an event, surrounded by eight very jovial
        students from China. I would love to have had the time and energy to strike
        up a conversation with them, but very soon that felt out of the question. It
        was a sign of concern to me when I pulled on my jacket and just had to
        make peace with that concern as the shivering kicked in. I had enough
        sense to pause and take some ibuprofen, and between that and good
        fortune (and many a trip to the loo), the fever broke into a sweat before I
        disembarked the train, weak as hell and fuzzy headed. A driver took me to
        my hotel, and that was pretty much it for me. Asleep by 0600 Sunday. Slept
        all Sunday off and on through till today, Monday.</p>
    <p>I’m awake and cautiously eating a breakfast by 1030. Muesli, yogurt, and
        fruit. Seems like a good idea, nothing too stressful, and my body seems to
        accept it well enough.</p>
    <p>At 1100 my driver from my arrival is back and we make a deal to tour the
        temples and set off. I’d be lying if I said I was at my full strength, but I can’t
        sit around forever. Truth told, getting out actually seems to help.</p>
    <p>There are several temple complexes within a few kilometers, and we drive
        the circuit. The carvings are beautiful, and quite intricate. The different
        temples are clearly all part of a set, they share a common flavor. All seem to
        have a certain sensuality to them, and some of them push toward the
        pornographic. Sacred sexuality. Yet the answers to all of this seem awkward
        at best. From what I can see, mainstream Hinduism (mainstream nearly all
        religions) doesn’t really feel comfortable with sexuality, and giving it a
        sacred status runs contrary to everything they know. Someone described
        these temples and statuary as a way to purge temptation. Not sure I buy
        that one, looking at those carvings. Looks sacred to me. Hieros Gamos.</p>
    <h3>1400</h3>
    <p>Back in hotel. Worn out but not wiped out, good sign. Spent money more
        freely than I would have liked, then I see how many rupees I still have
        stashed away and remember the exchange rate and relax a little. Gave a
        thousand rupees to a local school. It was quite a site. No kids there at the
        time, but the building was pretty meager. If I had had my brain at full
        steam I would have given a whole lot more, twenty bucks American seems
        silly, but every bit helps. I also had a lovely walk through the village, guided
        by a local who is studying English in university. In this village, unlike most
        of India after Gandhi, the caste system is still in place, though not as strict
        as it used to be. My guide, who appears to be a healthy, intelligent young
        man, is from the untouchable caste but is going to college. I take that as a
        positive. Some of the houses were decorated in bright colors, writing, and
        symbols. I am told this indicates a wedding celebration. I need to remind
        myself, not for the first time on this journey, that the swastika is a very old
        symbol, and was used for very holy and beautiful things long before the
        west was taught to see it as a sign of hatred, atrocity, and all the worst of
        human capacity. I am led to a local crafts shop, with wood and bronze
        statues, sandstone replicas of images from the temples, all amazing. Also,
        pages and pages and pages of beautiful illuminations from books long gone,
        and detailed replicas of these as well. The proprietor there welcomed melike royalty and we took our time looking over all sorts of things. And even
        when the sale was complete, he insisted that I stay and keep looking and
        gave me a chilled beverage. Business is done, you are my guest. Doubtless
        he’d have been quite ready to sell me more stuff, and as I looked at things,
        he would occasionally say that this or that item was very cheap, but always I
        felt welcome and not pushed. I ended up spending a fair amount of money
        in there, but felt at peace with it.</p>
    <h3>1735</h3>
    <p>sitting in my train car, AC just kicked on, waiting for full effect
        Last ride in the auto- rickshaw Witt my driver and his cousin, my guide
        from previous. We have a friendly chat when stopped at a railroad crossing
        and exchange email addresses. It seems a little insane, email here. This all
        feels so far removed from the twenty-first century as I typically think of it. I
        hold an iPhone 4s in my hand, one of the finest pieces of machinery ever
        invented, while people here are cooking their dinners with cow chips. I had
        mentally prepared myself for profound poverty, crowds, and liberal
        sanitation methods, and while I have no reason to be surprised, I probably
        could have explained all this to someone prior to my departure, somehow
        the reality of it, the chasm of … Well, is it civilization? technology? I don’t
        know, these people seem don’t seem destitute, they seem comfortable
        enough, so I don’t think of it as poverty. Is it cultural? Absolutely nothing
        wrong with that if it is. In the end, I suppose it’s a financial issue. If the
        money were there, modern conveniences would soon follow. Indian TV
        commercials have left no doubt of that. I don’t have answers, but this is why
        I travel: to see, to experience, to learn, to understand.</p>
    <p>On the same class of train as last time, but took a closer look this time. Not
        having a fever helps. There are four commodes on this train car: two fore
        and two aft. Three are eastern style squat holes. And one is a western sit
        down toilet. Thank God! I had a hell of a time on the last train: diarrhea,
        fatigue, fever, squat-hole toilet, moving train, you get the idea. And you do
        know why they post a sign asking you not to use the commode when at a
        station, right? That hole you are relieving yourself into just keeps on going,
        right on the tracks. I was mentally prepared for it, but am no less disturbed
        by India’s notions of healthy sanitation.</p>
    <p>Train off and rolling without incident. My slightly improved health,
        fortified with two precious Imodium tablets survive the trip intact.</p>
