    <h1>Day 47: A Pleasant Day </h1>
    <h2>Sunday 22 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>New Delhi, India</h3>
    <p>Last full day in Delhi, though I still have my day trip to Agra. Took me a
        while to get to sleep last night, no AC in this room, and I felt a little off
        when I dragged myself out of bed. It was a relaxed morning, leisurely
        shower and breakfast, then off by 1100.</p>
    <p>First stop, chosen by my guide was another swami temple. More down to
        earth than yesterday’s, and a little nicer for it in my humble opinion.
        Nothing stunning, but nice. And of course, no photos.</p>
    <p>We then made the drive to the main attraction of the day, Qutub Minar.
        Mughal Empire again, once a great mosque with a fabulous tower reaching
        into the sky. The mosque is in ruins, rather beautiful ruins, but the tower
        remains beautifully intact (or well repaired at least).</p>
    <p>We make a stop at the Railway Museum, which is clearly aimed more for
        locals that travelers like me, and rather young locals at that. But it is
        charming, with many preserved train cars and a charming museum exhibit.
        It’s a light day, so I take my time.</p>
    <p>Lastly, we stop by the India National Museum. It’s a pretty good museum,
        though a bit hot and stuffy. I enjoy the galleries and exhibits, but between you and me, you can see better stuff in
        New York or London. A shame, but there it
        Kali, Goddess of Power
        is, what can you do? Even the Elgin Marble is in London. And let’s not let
        Paris off the list either. Daylight robbery.
        Saraswati, Goddess of Education
        And really, that’s about it. I wander through the markets, enjoy some truly
        amazing tikka masala with the dusk.</p>
    <p>Ganga, Goddess River Ganges</p>
    <p>Kali, Goddess of Power</p>
    <p>Saraswati, Goddess of Education</p>
    <p>Early rise tomorrow, and I won’t kid myself about getting any sleep
        tomorrow night: return from Agra 2300, depart for airport 0200. Yuck.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
