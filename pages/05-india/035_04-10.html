    <h1>Day 35: Welcome To India</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 10 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Kolkata, India</h3>
    <h3>0900 Fairlawn Hotel, Kolkata, India</h3>

    <p>Let myself sleep in as late as I could. Still not entirely certain of my plans
        today.</p>
    <p>I did a quick check online: the amount of rupees I picked up at the currency
        exchange is about a year’s income for low-middle class people here. So
        yeah, lots of money. They average about US $2 a day. So the tips I gave to
        my cab
        driver and the dude who showed me to my room last night, both insanely
        good my local standards. I was afraid I was being cheap. Worth paying
        attention to. And I’ll need to get some smaller bills. The smallest I have is
        500 rupees, or just under US $10. So in other words, a rupee here to the
        locals is what a dollar might be to me in the States.</p>
    <p>I’ve had no time to get any bottled water. Brushing my teeth without any
        water at all, certainly not tap water, was interesting but not s big deal.
        Reasonable shower. A tea set and electric kettle in the room, so a make
        myself a cup of tea, boiled water should be ok, can’t fear everything.</p>
    <p>Went downstairs and had breakfast. Fried eggs, toast, fried tomato,
        mushrooms, and a small circle of hash or sausage. And of course, tea. Pot
        brought to the table, complete with tea- cozy. Tea grounds used, not bags. I
        had a glance at the dregs of my cup, to see if I could read tea leaves without
        any success. All I really know to look for I learned from Harry Potter, no
        grim that I could see.</p>
    <p>From there I went for a walk. Visions of trudging through human waste as I
        step over dead children came to naught. The streets are certainly third
        world, but none of the insanity one hears tales of.</p>
    <p>Of course, it’s early yet. My hotel is one block away from the Indian
        Museum, which I understand is quite large and interesting, but as this is
        my first time on the streets of India, I give it a pass and keep walking.</p>
    <p>After some interesting rambling, I make it to the rather impressive Victoria
        Memorial. The grounds surrounding have a pleasant and well maintained
        park, and the building itself stands out
        quite distinctly in white marble. I went inside and was surprised to discover
        a very nice museum, larger than I would have thought possible, complete
        with a life- size recreation of an old Calcutta street. Many old marble
        statues of British leaders in India, many beautiful paintings of Indian
        leaders in India. As the citizen of a country that
        broke colonial ties with England at the point of a gun but now calls England
        a dear friend, I find myself curious as to India’s relationship with its British
        past. Complicated, no doubt. I suppose all imperialism comes with certain
        advantages, but I cannot doubt that self determination is always always the
        highest good. I would have taken
        lots of pics, but the man at the door specifically asked me to take no
        photographs. A sign I usually obey but not always. A polite and reasonable
        request: that I must respect.</p>
        <h3>1330</h3>
    <p>Indian museum. Good but only one room with AC. Lots of fans but that just
        doesn’t cut it. Further, I just realized that I have been moving without real
        rest through this heat and humidity and have had nothing to drink but a
        little tea this morning. I need to get some water in me. Soon.</p>
    <h3>1445</h3>
    <p>Back at Fairlawn. I order chicken tikka and water. Not sure what
        chicken tikka is, but it’s a start. The chicken tikka is excellent. Thai food is
        delicious,
        but nothing compares to the amazingly delicious food of India. I drank a
        full liter of water with lunch then bought two more liters for later.</p>
    <p><I’m not entirely sure what else to do with my time in Kolkata, I’ve seen the
        one major sight I wanted to see. I’d like to have a walk north, through the
        center of town. Perhaps this evening or tomorrow./p>
    <p>240 rupees for lunch, with three liter bottled of water. Not quite five
        dollars. I can live with that. And the two attractions both were 150r apiece.For foreigners of course, much much cheaper for locals. The two economy
        thing makes it a little harder for me to get a real sense of costs.</p>
    <p>After lunch I return to my room to find the AC running full blast. I know I
        did not do that, but can’t say I mind just now. I flip through the tv and
        watch a few moments of local tv, all very dramatic, before taking a wee nap.</p>
    <p>I’m up and out soon after, and I walk through the streets past vendors and
        stalls of every kind. The place is packed with people. Any road that isn’t
        bustling with cars the pedestrians take over, and when cars come, they
        move slowly, leaning on their horn as they do.</p>
    <p>Interesting side note: on two separate occasions, people whom I would
        assume are local Indians asked me for directions, one of them started by
        asking in Hindi! I couldn’t answer his question, but the other question I
        answered as well as I could. If it was some sort of scam, it certainly seemed
        without profit. Nothing stolen. Do I look enough like a local? Or at least like
        an expat? My clothes blend in a little better here than in previous countries,
        and I declined to carry along my camera. And that makes a big difference, I
        think: how could I be a tourist without a camera? As it is, my iPhone
        camera seems to work fine and is far more discreet.</p>
    <p>I make it back to my hotel just in time to avoid a thorough soaking from a
        truly awe inspiring tropical storm. I miss storms like this. I enjoy my
        dinner, then sit in the common area and read for a bit before eventually
        turning in.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow, more Kolkata during the day, then a sleeper train to my next
        destination: Varanasi, once known as Benares.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
