    <h1>Day 46:More Delhi</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 21 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>New Delhi, India</h3>
    <p>So a word about my neighborhood. The hotel is nice enough, hidden in a
        small maze of alleys. The area I am staying appears to be called “the Great
        Bazaar,” a title conjuring no small amount of mystery and exoticism. While
        the romanticism is much alloyed with dirt and dust, chaos, and the
        occasional smell of stale urine, I confess it does deliver. It’s quite an area,
        and getting lost is not out of the questions. A mass of shops of trinkets and
        odds and ends, of fresh vegetables of questionable cleanliness, and of street
        chefs cooking their wares just about anywhere. The most appealing and safe
        looking restaurants appear to be located on rooftops, four or five stories
        removed from the pulse of chaos below, but in no way a shelter from the
        sounds of traffic.</p>
    <p>Today I sleep in and am off in my auto-rickshaw with my driver by 1100.
        My first stop is a truly huge and beautiful temple dedicated to Swami
        Narayan, a revered figure from the nineteenth century. Unlike the lotus
        temple yesterday which was high in vision but poor in maintenance, this
        place is gigantic, immaculate, manicured, perfectly maintained. Beautiful
        stone work alive with figures of people and animals, flowing water and
        polished stone are everywhere. I would show you in photograph, but my
        phone and camera had to be checked prior to entry. The interior of the
        temple was focused on the afore mentioned swami, with four couples from
        Hindu religion depicted at the four corners of the temple. Rama and Sita I
        remember, as well as Krishna and Radha. The rest I’m not as sure about.</p>
    <p>After the temple I decide to explore the vast grounds to discover that they
        have an animatronic attraction, as well as a cultural boat ride. Figuring this
        is an opportunity, I go for the animatronic thing to see what they’ve got. I
        must say, it was very well done. High quality, very well funded, and
        perfectly maintained. We were led to a room where we sat and watched a
        three minute show about an episode from the swami’s childhood. After this
        was done, we were led to the next room for the next episode. I couldn’t help
        thinking of Disney’s long gone attraction America Sings. Then I thought of
        the cultural boat ride and had to fight the urge to start singing “Yo Ho Yo
        Ho! A Swami’s Life For Me!” as we walked from room to room. Well, I
        really didn’t get much of a spiritual vibe from this whole place anyway, but
        this was the nail in the coffin. I made my way back to my driver.</p>
    <p>From here we drive to the famous Red Fort, which is quite lovely, though I
        think it has seen better days. It makes a good comparison with the Amber
        Fort I visited in Agra. Made by the sane culture, the Mughals, at more orless the same time, 1600s. These are also the same folks who made the
        temple I was so impressed with last evening, and who made the Taj Mahal,
        which I’ll be seeing on Monday.</p>
    <p>Vast walls and a moat surround the large complex. The moat is now absent
        of water but thick with very talk grass. The sky above the fort seems thick
        with birds of prey, which leaves me wondering what do they know that I
        don’t? It’s an issue never adequately resolved. There is a main gate which
        leads to a bazaar area now filled with tourist vendors. I see a sign declaring
        this bazaar area to be known as Diwan-I-am, which just thrills me. I look
        around for fuzzy people making rhymes about mis-colored breakfast food
        without success. A line quickly pops into my head: “With such a lovely
        name as that, not a single rhyme! My mood went splat!” I see I am the only
        one getting the joke and move on. Sigh. At least I like my own jokes.</p>
    <p>The other buildings here include a great meeting hall and throne room,
        quite impressive, and some of the king’s private areas, though again, time
        has been rough. One building has been converted into a passable museum,
        and a sign outside declares this to be the building if the queen’s chamber. I
        find this to be a nice and delicate bit of side- stepping, my own researches
        informing me that this is also where the king’s harem was at. Minor detail,
        right?</p>
    <p>It’s getting a bit late so we swing by my hotel room so I can pick up some
        things and hit a post office, lightening my pack a bit. After that I avail
        myself of one of those fine rooftop diners and stuff myself to bursting with
        biriani before calling it a night. One more day in Delhi with my driver.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
