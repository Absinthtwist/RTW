    <h1>Day 37: The Sacred River Ganga</h1>
    <h2>Tursday 12 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Transition to Varanasi, India</h3>
    <p>Almost noon and I’m still on the train. The frequent stops don’t help
        matters. But I have a window seat with a constantly amazing view, so I
        don’t complain. Sixteen hours on a train is much more tolerable than on an
        aircraft.</p>
    <h3>1430</h3>
    <p>Made it to hotel, but pretty wiped out. Walked from the train station, not
        far, five and a half kilometers, and I was doing fine till I stepped into the
        hotel lobby. Suddenly the sweat was coming off me in sheets. Still
        reasonably hot here in Varanasi, though not quite as hot as Kolkata, but
        with only a fraction of the humidity. Best part: when I got to my room I was
        told they just repaired the shower and that I shouldn’t use it for the next</p>
    <p>The streets of Kolkata were interesting, but Varanasi wins. More vibrant,
        chaotic, noisy, muddy, more animals. For the first time I had a child follow
        me for a block, tugging and then eventually grabbing a hold of my arm. Hewanted a drink of my water. He looked adequately healthy, and I’m sorry,
        but I protect myself and my water closely.</p>
    <p>I relax for a bit then am out for a bite to eat and to explore. Remiscent of my
        Thai tattoo (which is doing nicely btw, solo aftercare on a back tattoo is
        complicated but manageable), one of my goals got this stage of the trip is
        rather unsanitary: to bathe in the Sacred River Ganges. It is notoriously
        filthy, but I would regret it and call myself a weenie if I didn’t get in there at
        least a little. Never mind the sewage or human corpses.</p>
    <p>In the restaurant, at a loss for what to order, I see the local specialties
        combo plate and give it a go. We start with a sort of salad, reminiscent of
        pico de gallo with cucumbers served over what I swear is a baked tortilla.
        Indian tostada. I don’t make this stuff up, I just report it. Next is a cup of
        soup. It’s a mildly sweet tomato soup with a couple of lovely croutons. Quite
        enjoyable. Then the big one. A huge plate with what I would call nan, a cup
        of light rice, and several small cups of various creams for dipping. There is
        also a lassi and a small round of sweet dough infused with syrup. Amazing,
        but too much food even for me. I do what damage I can, express my
        gratitude, and am on my way.</p>
    <p>Wow.</p>
    <p>I walk to the river’s edge, to the ghats. There are certainly more westerners
        here than I have yet seen in India. Though I must say, any tourist coming
        here is probably not wearing the Bermuda shorts complaining about no
        HBO or jacuzzi at their hotel. I think at this point you are less a tourist and
        more a traveler. I allow a couple kids to talk me into buying two floating
        candles, a watch a few other kids play a pick-up game of cricket, which as
        an American I completely fail to understand. I’ve had it explained to me, I
        understood at the time, then five minutes later was again in total confusion.</p>
    <p>As the sun set, I hired a man to take me onto the river in his boat. Really, all
        you have to do is hold still and someone will come to you asking if you want
        a boat. It’s just like on the streets, you are constantly saying no thank you to
        offers of tuk-tuk rides.</p>
    <p>My boatman’s name is Ganesa, and he seems quite nice, though I don’t fully
        understand everything he says (sidebar: I flipped through TV in Kolkata to
        find Harry Potter, in English with English subtitles. Same language, same
        trouble understanding one another). The sky slowly darkens as we proceed.I can see that this is really a far more powerful way to see the riverbank, you
        get a far better look at the amazing buildings. And as dusk turns to evening,
        people prepare for their big rituals.</p>
    <p>For those who do know, it’s worth a pause here. The Hindu people worship
        the Ganges River as a Goddess. They don’t say the Ganges, they just say
        Ganga, like the name of a person. No “the” to signify a thing rather than a
        person. Further, they believe that those who die here, or those whose
        bodies are cremated and whose ashes are given to Ganga, those people
        escape the karmic wheel of reincarnation and they go straight to Nirvana.
        So needless to say, they do a pretty good trade here. Every day, every night,
        seven days a week, no holiday breaks, there is always always at least one
        human body being burned to ashes here on the shore of Ganga. This is a
        very sacred thing. When a man dies, his son brings him here to perform the
        rights. He shaves his head and wears only white, the Hindu color of
        mourning. The body is prepared. Special scented wood is gathered and I
        pyre is built. He takes a bit of straw to the eternal flame, a fire that has been
        continually tended for the last twenty-six hundred years or so (Varanasi is
        one of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world), and the pyre is
        set ablaze. I must have seen a dozen or more such pyres this evening, and I
        can tell you, it is a powerful sight.</p>
    <p>At one point, my boatman brought me ashore right close to a grouping of
        five or more pyres. One of the men in charge of these fires walked me
        around, showed me the wood, the eternal flame, how they prepare the
        pyres. I was inches away from the fires. One of the most amazing and
        intense experiences I can remember having. Was I shown all this as a way
        to get money? No doubt (people keep showing up to be burned even
        without cash for the wood, etc). Did I care? Not particularly. Did I give
        money? Not as much as they were hoping, I’m sure, but still, for me, a good
        amount. And I absolutely feel that I got my money’s worth. Truly fantastic.</p>
    <p>After that, my boatman rowed me back. As we drifted away from the main
        fires and rituals and music (though we did pass a couple of quiet, more
        modest and somber fires), things became quite peaceful. Quiet. The water
        under the oars. Chirping of insects. The distant sound of drums carried on
        the wind.</p>
    <p>Hard to top that, though I’m told that dawn is a great experience too. Just
        not sure I’m gonna want to get to at 0500 after that train ride. Plus I still
        have the following day. Savor it.</p>
    <p>All in all, a good day.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
