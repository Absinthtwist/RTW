    <h1>Day 42: Sleeper Trains Suck</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 17 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Transition from Khajuraho to Jaipur, India</h3>
    <p>Today is officially day forty-two but it still feels like forty-one. It’s 0230 in
        the morning as I step off the train in Agra. Agra is certainly on my must-see
        list, Taj Mahal, but that comes later. This is just a layover. In a clever trick I
        came up from the comfort of my bedroom in the states, I ride the train till
        two am, then wait three hours and take a taxi across town to connect with
        another train. Sigh… See, the idea in my head was that the sleeper train
        gave me more time. These rides are twelve hours and longer. A day, gone.
        The idea in my head was that I’d be ok sleeping on a train, that it has this
        romantic air about it. Ok, good learning experience, healthy sleep is far
        more important. So my Agra to Delhi run is a night train, maybe I can
        change that. I also bought a similar train ticket from Luxor to Cairo which
        is meant to be delivered to my hotel in Luxor. If its there, fine. If not, Divine
        intervention.</p>
        <h3>1100</h3>
    <p>approaching Jaipur. First impression, more modern. Cleaner.
        Glimpsed a camel being led down the street. As we get deeper into town
        things get a bit messier.</p>
    <p>As soon as I get off the train I am approached asking if I need transport to a
        hotel. I’m getting kinda used to this, so I give him the name of my hotel and
        we agree on a price. I follow the man out and am stunned not to find
        another auto- rickshaw but an actual car, with AC. The driver and I set off,
        and we converse about my plans here in Jaipur. He gives me his business
        card which lists many of the top sights to see, and is quite willing to drive
        me around. I’m getting the feeling the pickup from the train station is less
        about the fare as it is about a tour job. Well, he seems a right enough guy,
        and his English is good, so I agree. I tell him I’m dead tired and need a nap
        and we decide he’ll pick me up at 1600.</p>
    <p>The drive through town confirms my initial impressions via train. Quite a
        different city, Jaipur. We even pass a KFC. The colonel is the real US
        ambassador to the world. The traffic signs are more or less obeyed. The
        streets are kinda clean. The gain smell of sewage still persists, but only
        distantly. There is clearly more of a tourist presence here, and I am
        reminded that I am now in the Golden Triangle. This is the big triumvirateof tourist cities in India of New Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur. It’s still a far cry
        from Disneyland, but it’s a whole lot more tourist friendly than Varanasi.</p>
    <p>The hotel room almost makes me cry. The AC is frigid and the bed so soft
        and comfy, when I sit for a sec to try it, it’s hard not to fall asleep. I quickly
        hand-wash some clothes in the sink, I’m still uncomfortable turning my
        laundry over to anyone else to wash, in any country. Here, where
        replacement clothes may be impossible given my height and frame, perhaps
        a little more so. After washing what I can quickly, I fall into bed and right to
        sleep.</p>
    <p>When my alarm goes off at 1530 I know I’ll be useless for sightseeing, so
        come 1600 I’m downstairs making my apologies and we set for 0900
        tomorrow. Here’s to banishing cynicism and that this driver is really and
        nice as he seems. Most people I have talked to in India have been genuinely
        hospitable.</p>
    <p>I sleep for a wee bit, hand-wash another bit of clothes, then, realizing I have
        not eaten in twenty-four hours, decide to be silly and treat myself to the
        Colonel’s eleven herbs and spices. It’s a short walk, and I order a three piece
        chicken meal. Of the various images in the dining area, the one the strikes
        me is an image of two very buff Indian men arm-wrestling. I remember
        reading in my Gandhi autobiography how when he was young, late
        nineteenth century, there was an argument around India that the reason
        the British were so successful was because they ate meat. It made them
        strong and healthy. Gandhi had been raised in a culture where
        vegetarianism was the practice. This idea that meat eating equals macho
        strength is a curiosity to me. Is this image here on this wall a glimpse into
        how that thinking is still, on some level, present? The vast majority of
        Indians I see on the street are very thin. Of course, then I turn on
        Bollywood TV and wonder who the fuck those people are, because they sure
        as hell don’t look Indian to me. Dark hair and accents, sure. But beautiful
        fair skin, and many of the male stars are built like pro-wrestlers. Now, I do
        see a few more athletic Indians, but those people on TV are just…alien. It
        unnerves me a bit.</p>
    <p>They sell a skin cream to make your skin lighter, lots of commercials for
        that. Gotta say, coming from the States, where we have our own race issues,
        seeing people pay money to fake a skin color freaks me out a bit. Of course,
        we have fake tans, but I don’t dig those either. It’s just bizarre to me.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I only manage to eat the one piece of chicken. The way I’ve been
        going the past few days, small wonder my stomach has shrunk a bit, and no
        harm there. I wrap up the other two pieces and head back home for a big fat
        nothing and some sleep.</p>
    <p>Long-ass day. I am content to have waived off the sight-seeing till
        tomorrow. Sleeper trains are an epic fail, I must say, though I am glad have
        had the experience. Tomorrow I’m going to see if I can arrange more
        sensible transport to Delhi.</p>
    <p>Safe Journey!</p>
