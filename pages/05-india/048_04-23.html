    <h1>Day 48: Last Day In India </h1>
    <h2>Monday 23 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>New Delhi, with a side trip to Agra, India</h3>
    <p>Awoke earlier than I’d like and got a ride across town to the train station.
        Ironic in that I’m a block away from the biggest train station in Delhi, but
        haven’t set foot in there. Wrong station for my needs. The train ride is
        adequate enough, I can’t complain, and I’m in Agra arranging a ride by
        1130.</p>
    <p>By noon, in the dusty, unforgiving heat, I arrive at one of the most iconic
        sights on earth. The Taj Mahal Some things don’t quite live up to their
        hype, others surpass them. The Taj Mahal is breath-taking. All of the
        complex surrounding it seem to focus the experience. And I must say, the
        people of Agra tend to take their world heritage responsibilities seriously:
        Agra and the surrounding area is free of factories and industries. Just
        tourism and crafts. That precious white marble needs to be protected. They
        even make all the visitors put little disposable booties over their shoes just
        like OR. It was hard to pull myself away, but eventually, it’s time to move
        on.</p>
    <p>Having the driver for the day and plenty of time to kill, I am taken to see
        some of the local crafts, very beautiful, and am even treated to a musical
        demonstration, a private concert just for me of drums and sitar. It felt a
        little awkward being the only audience, knowing I wasn’t gonna drop the
        two grand US for a nice new sitar, but I settle into it and accept it for what it
        is: hospitality.</p>
    <p>From here I am taken to Agra Fort. Made by the Mughals around the same
        time as the Red Fort and Amber Fort I’ve already seen (as well as the Taj
        Mahal), I’m not certain how thrilling this will be, but I am pleasantly
        surprised. The other two forts, particularly the Red Fort in Delhi, have been
        pretty beat up. The red fort was all but leveled by the British following an
        Indian rebellion in the 1850s, and this fort is in wonderful condition. I can
        imagine the Mughal maharaja leaning over his balcony down the river to
        the awesome view of the Taj. It’s a gorgeous image.</p>
    <p>With still a bit of a wait but already having spent way too much money, I
        return to the train station to chill for a bit. I won’t really have time to sleep
        before catching my plane, so today shall be very long indeed.</p>
    <p>My train to Delhi is delayed, and I make to my hotel by midnight.</p>
    <p>To be continued…</p>
