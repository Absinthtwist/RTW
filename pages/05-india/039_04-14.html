    <h1>Day 39: Under The Weather</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 14 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Varanasi, India</h3>
   <p>Another rough night. Hot as hell, upset stomach and nausea. A couple trips
    to the bathroom, but not as bad as could be. Checked out of hotel and by
    1100 I’m back at the same bakery as yesterday. My train leaves at 1800 and
    I’ve decided to take today easy. Not entirely sure how to pull that off, here
    in Varanasi, but I’ll do what I can.</p>
    <h3>1300</h3>
   <p>Still in my bakery. Had crepes for breakfast, with a touch of lime and
    sugar. More water. Sipping 7up while I read more if my Gandhi book. My
    back is sore and I feel exhausted. Keep drinking water.</p>
   <p>Feeling better after a warm meal and nearly two liters of fluid into me. I
    take a bicycle-ricksha to the train station. My first time on such a
    conveyance, and clearly it was made for smaller people than I. As we ride
    through the chaos, I can’t help thinking one good pothole and out I go. Butmy driver steers us right and without incident. As we approach the train
    station (which I did not see coming into town), the city displays a bit of a
    change. Fewer potholes and more paved roads. The buildings are taller,
    three sometimes four stories high. And more and better organized vendors.</p>
   <p>As I wait for my train, I am treated to the view of monkeys, casually
    hanging out on the tracks. No one seems to care.
    By 1750 I’m seated in my train and ready to go. Looks reasonably
    comfortable. I got a main seat, not that crappy side seat like last time. I
    think that will make the difference. Not as full, either. Khajuraho strikes me
    as more of a tourist location, less traffic. Sounds backwards, but there’s a
    lot of that going around in India.</p>
