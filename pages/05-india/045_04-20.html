    <h1>Day 45:New Delhi</h1>
    <h2>Friday 20 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Transition from Jaipur to New Delhi, India</h3>
    <p>I drag myself out of bed at 0430, grab my gear and am at the train station
        in less than an hour. The train rolls off on time, and I lean back in my seat.
        This is my first taste of an Indian train that is not a sleeper, and I
        understand the sleeper’s appeal a little better. Slightly better than an
        airplane seat, this lacks the comfort of the sleeper.</p>
    <p>We pull into New Delhi around 1030, and as it is only five kilometers and
        I’m feeling as good as I can expect, I decide to walk to my hotel, knowing I
        can grab a ride if needed. Delhi certainly seems the cleanest and most well
        organized of all the Indian cities I’ve yet seen, and is blessed with an
        underground sewage system. The area for maybe a kilometer around my
        hotel is all one big market area, I giant swap-meet, and is more or less a
        pedestrian street. The hotel room itself is comfortable and adequate.</p>
    <p>After I freshen up a bit, I head out and walk another kilometer of to to
        Connaught Place, a leftover from the British rule, a circular plaza acting as a
        hub from which the streets all radiate. A bit dusty and dirty, but still some
        high end shops are present here. Realizing I have not yet eaten today, I stop
        for a bit and gravitate to a small Indian sports bar with a cowboy theme
        serving Mexican food. The servers are dressed as cowboys, with six-
        shooters at their hips. Food wasn’t half bad.</p>
    <p>From here my thought was to head to the Gandhi memorial, so I grabbed
        an auto-rickshaw and was off. My driver, Gopal, is a man in his late fifties
        with a full beard and a turban, a Sikh. We start talking, and he invites me to
        the Sikh high temple. As its right on the way, we have a stop.</p>
    <p>We enter a large underground parking structure, a first for me in India, and
        we step out to the entrance of the temple grounds. He leads me past the
        crowds waiting to an area I can safely leave my shoes, and I follow him,
        barefoot. We come to an up staircase where the first step actually recedes a
        couple inches and has clear water running through it. I wash my feet, walk
        the padded stairs up to a large sink where I wash my hands. My experiences
        in India have only encouraged my love of cleanliness, so this is all to the
        good. We walk across a marble plaza and come to a giant square pool. It is
        not for swimming, but for ritual bathing, or even to sit in and pray. I can see
        several fish swimming through the water, and a separate walled off part of
        the pool for ladies.</p>
    <p>We turn back to the main hall. The center of the room contains a golden
        altar, and placed there is their holy book. No statues or pictures of people,
        only their holy book. A few people are playing music, and it’s quite lovely.
        He leads me upstairs, where I find a few people resting comfortably on the
        floor, reading. There are a few small rooms, with walls of glass, where
        people sit and read. And he shows me, behind veils, and beautiful bed. This
        is where their holy book spends the night. We lean over the railing and look
        over the main room of the temple through which we came. People are
        seated here and there. In prayer, in conversation, in community. Men with
        women, high born with low.</p>
    <p>We head back downstairs and walk to the next building. Upstairs is another
        large reading room, and downstairs is a large open room with rows of
        people, all seated together in these rows, each eating a tray of hearty food. I
        am led into the back where the food is prepared. The food is served all day,
        and all the food is donated. The food is prepared and served by volunteers.
        People come and eat together in community, no class or gender
        segregation. Beggar next to the prince. I like. When, they are finished, they
        clean up, and the next lot come in and eat. All very beautiful, really.</p>
    <p>We say our goodbyes to the Sikh temple and head to the Gandhi Smriti,
        which is composed of the house where he spent the last 144 days of his life
        and the ground where he was shot and killed. The grounds are very lovely,and there is a very tasteful set of footprints, his last steps, leading from his
        back door out to the lawn behind his house. At the spot where the steps
        come to an end stands a small shrine. Inside the house is a simple museum,
        and his bedroom is preserved.</p>
    <p>From here Gopal, my driver, suggests to take me to the Baha’i Lotus
        Temple. It’s a little further away, but as its on my list, I agree. It’s about a
        thirty minute drive through traffic via highway, and we come at last to a
        large gated complex. I go in, the place teeming with people. I can see that
        these grounds were once very beautiful, grass and flowers, but they don’t
        seem to be getting consistent water and suffering for it. At the far end of the
        garden path stand the great temple. Quite large, and shaped like a lotus
        blossom, it is no less reminiscent of the Sydney Opera House. The crowd
        and I are corralled through and our shoes are removed and stored. We
        enter the temple itself, which is stunning inside, with a great high ceiling
        and marble benches, but the either the designer neglected to consider
        ventilation or something had been shut off, but I find it stifling in here and
        don’t stay long. As I walk back to my driver, all I can think of I Cary Grant
        from the Bishop’s Wife: one big roof or lots of little roofs, which do people
        here need more?</p>
    <p>The day is heading to dusk and I’m a little worn down, but Gopal has one
        more sight for me: Humayun’s Tomb. Well, again, it’s on the list, so what
        the hell. It’s a bit of a drive back, so when we park, I am glad to stand and
        walk. The grounds here are not so grand as the lotus temple, but better
        cared for, more green, and are quite lovely. I’m enjoying the grounds and
        the lovely ruins of old gates s much, that when I turn a corner and see the
        tomb, I catch my breath. It’s beautiful. I can only describe it as practice for
        the Taj Mahal. Very similar in shape and style, though much smaller (but
        still quite impressive). I take my time walking around and through as the
        dusk descends, then call it a day and return to my hotel. Gopal and I agree
        to see more tomorrow and will meet at 1100</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
