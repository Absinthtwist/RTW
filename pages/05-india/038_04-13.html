    <h1>Day 38: Too Hot</h1>
    <h2>Friday 13 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Varanasi, India</h3>
    <p>First really rough night of trip. The ceiling fan no doubt helped some, but
        still quite hot, and the bed is the hardest I have yet slept on, which is truly
        saying something. When my alarm goes off at 0500 I shut it off and try for
        more sleep. Knowing I’ve missed my morning window today, I sleep in and
        take my time. Tomorrow I simply must be up early, but today I take it easy.
        I hand wash yesterday’s clothes in the sink and hang them to dry. That
        done, I casually saunter out the door by 1100 or so.</p>
    <p>Across the street from my hotel is a crumbling brick and white-wash
        building claiming to be a movie theatre. I have a look and see, with a
        grimace that not only are they showing an American film, but a truly bad
        looking one. Still, a movie experience with an audience full of Indians,
        tempting. And the thought that it is likely dubbed into Hindi does improve
        its appeal. Still, my trusty google map says there’s another theatre down the
        road a bit. Might be worth a look.</p>
    <p>I make my way through the bustling streets until I see a place advertising
        itself in English as a bakery, restaurant, and shop. The bold English writing
        and the promise of wifi screams “tourists only please,” but screw it. And
        tourist in Varanasi means something different, I think.</p>
    <p>I step inside and find two other tables filled, westerners of course. On one
        table is a somber and rather androgynous person going over her(?) various
        papers, writing. At another table sits a young European couple, finishing
        drinks and playing UNO. The menu has a variety of non-Indian foods,
        American, French, German. I even see a burger on the menu, thoughabsolutely not beef. And absolutely no Indian food on the menu. Rather
        than leave, I decide to stick it out and enjoy the relative cool shelter here for
        now. On a whim, I order nachos and a cheese sandwich. I must say the
        bread of the sandwich is fantastic, and the nachos surprisingly good. The
        salsa is impressive, and the chips, a fried flour tortilla rather than corn,
        make it interesting. I wash it down with a 7up and a liter of water for the
        road. The proprietor offers me tiramisu, but I’m quite full and leave well
        enough alone.</p>
    <p>I remember once a friend of mine, not from America or Europe, who felt
        uncomfortable around dogs. He explained, very courteously, that where he
        comes from, dogs are perceived very differently. Looking out the window of
        my bakery retreat, I watch the street and see the occasional dog wander by.
        There are no leash laws in effect here in Varanasi. The dogs give every
        impression of living not just on the street but from the street. They root
        around for what scraps they can, wander where they like. Yesterday I had a
        friendly run-in with a dog, she came up to me as I sat on the steps of a ghat
        and we had a pleasant moment. But it occurred to me, even as I scratched
        behind her ears, that this is no domesticated American dog, with all her
        shots and I microchip. Her mood could turn in a dime and a bite could
        quickly lead to rabies. Shortly after, as if to reinforce the point, as I was
        walking I came across a pack of dogs all lying together. When I got a little
        too close, the alpha became very vocal regarding his displeasure, and would
        not silence until I was well and away. Here in the streets of India, dogs are
        wild animals. Point taken.</p>
    <p>I finish my 7up and see where the road takes me. I have a general idea to
        look for that movie theatre, if I can find it. The other I found was not di
        obvious. As I approach, however, I am stunned by what I see. A mall. A
        glass and steel modern mall. Tiny by American standards, but here it looks
        like a space ship. I must investigate.</p>
    <p>I have to go through a metal detector and a pat-down to enter. A bit funny
        seeing how loaded all my pockets are and I wasn’t required to show any of
        it. The mall was a bit unimpressive, one big room going up three stories,
        escalators, lukewarm AC (emphasis on warm), and a good three or four
        derelict storefronts. Attached from the outside is the promised movie
        theatre, with some better viewing options, but I’m not feeling it just now so
        I keep walking.</p>
    <p>I wander the streets, cutting through a few alleys, which appear to be
        residential in nature. I discreetly make my way past and head back to my
        hotel room. Sleeping in seems a less intelligent choice just now. I would be
        wiser to wake early then nap through the worst heat of the day. Foolish of
        me to forget this. Tomorrow I need to check out of my hotel, so I lose my
        siesta option. I’m feeling dehydrated and worn down more than I would
        have expected. Guess its been a while since I lived in this sort of intense
        heat. I’m starting to rethink the early start tomorrow. No doubt dawn on
        the Ganges would be phenomenal, but I’m not feeling too great just now,
        and I don’t think anything can top my last Ganges experience. We’ll see.</p>
    <p>With only a quick run to grab some good and four liters of water, I decide to
        just lay low. I love the streets, but the heat is profound. I spend the evening
        updating my website as best I can while watching Bollywood music videos.
        They are quite a cultural window.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow I take the train to the sacred temples of Khajuraho. In the
        meantime, lots of water!</p>
    <p>Safe journey!</p>
