    <h1>Day 36: Oh Calcutta</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 11 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Kolkata, India</h3>
    <p>I checked out of Fairlawn and had a good breakfast, then set out for my
        final day in Kolkata.</p>
    <p>The streets are packed with people, vendor stalls and food stands. Hand
        water pumps every block or so. Shoe-Shines working their trade. Barbers
        without chair, on the pavement with the rest of us, their customers hunched
        down for a haircut, or even more dramatic, a straight razor shave, right
        there on the street. Nobody trip or stumble. Good time to grow out that
        beard.</p>
    <p>There is no McDonalds here. No KFC. There are a few tiny oases of western
        upscale shopping, but blink and they are gone.</p>
    <p>Kolkata isn’t a place of tourist attractions beyond itself. I saw the Victoria
        Memorial as discussed. A further distance away is a shelter set up by
        Mother Theresa. There’s the Writers’ Building, mentioned in all the
        guidebooks. The building itself is nice enough, I just like the idea of an
        entire building just for writers. The reality, a building for scribes and
        bureaucrats, is less romantic.</p>
    <p>Knowing I will eventually need to cross the Hooghly River, I start heading
        west, following the flow. I end up in an area with far fewer stalls, with
        women sorting through greens. I see many people, men and women, with
        tremendous bundles placed upon their heads walking hurriedly. They seem
        to all be flowing to an overpass and I figure, what the hell, and I follow. We
        pass over a rail track and end up in who knows what. A giant flower wreath
        market. Many many orange flower wreaths, packed with people. At this
        point, I am without a doubt the only non-Indian around. I just soak it up,
        try to go with the flow, not offend anyone or stand out more than I already
        do.</p>
    <p>I eventually find my way to the large bridge going over the river, and the
        difference in tone is dramatic. Paved streets are replaced with crumbling
        brick. Four and five story buildings are replaced by single story simple
        brick. Mud, dirt, what sanitation there was to the east has slipped away. I
        see a cow just hanging out on the street and can only conclude that this is
        the oft spoken-of Holy Cow. I see another such cow and give a wide berth.
        The one prominent building here, in bold colors and reasonable repair, and
        twice as tall as its neighbors, is a Catholic church.</p>
    <p>I eventually make my way to the train station, which dwarfs most all of
        Kolkata I’ve seen to date, including the airport, with the clear exception of
        the Victoria Memorial. The Writer’s Building was possibly larger as well.But the station, as in China, is a beehive. Full of activity. There are many
        electric fans for which I am grateful. I grab some local food, delicious, and
        have a seat on my pack on the floor as I wait for my train.</p>
    <p>I’m early and it’s a bit of a wait, but the train does leave on time. I had
        selected AC second class sleeper, and it’s adequate. On the left side of the
        train car are two single seats facing each other which shift into a single bed.
        To the right are two benches, comfortably seating three or four, facing each
        other, and they too convert to beds. There are likewise beds directly above
        as well, and this pattern is repeated perhaps a dozen times through the car.
        I am on the left side with my single bed, and the majority of the AC goes to
        the other side. I have a curtain for privacy which, when closed, is far too
        stuffy, so I leave open. I wouldn’t call it comfortable, but it’s enough. I
        picked up an autobiography by Gandhi in the station, seemed appropriate,
        read for a bit, the shut out the light. Gonna be a long ride.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
