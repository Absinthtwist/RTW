    <h1>Day 44: Bollywood!</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 19 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Jaipur, India</h3>
    <p>Utterly lazy day. Crawl out of bed by 1100, amble out for some lunch. Hang
        out, take a few pics. At 1400, I decide I want to do something, and head out
        for a movie.</p>
    <p>I find the Raj Mandir Cinema Hall. It looks nice enough from the outside,
        but I brace myself. Realistically, torn seats, dusty ceiling fans and stifling
        heat all seem about right. I get in line to buy my ticket. Two lines, one for
        ladies another for gents. There are three ticket classes, and I figure I’m
        probably better off going high-end. The fellow in front of me is maybe
        eighteen, and has the same idea. As those seats are sold in pairs, we team
        up. My new friend’s name is Krishna, and together we step in as I prepare
        for the worst.</p>
    <p>I am stunned. Nothing could have prepared me for this. Its a palace. A
        quick check with Wikipedia shows that this place was built in the 1970s, but
        it is beautifully maintained and immaculate. The seats seem pretty
        standard, with my premium seats at about what most Americans are used
        to these days. I’m in the balcony, and have a good uninstructed view at the
        isle.</p>
    <p>The lights dim, the movie starts. It’s all in Hindi with a few words of english
        here and there, but aside from nuance, I follow it pretty well. The film is
        called Housefull 2, and is a romantic comedy with concealed identities,
        mistaken identities, all sorts of loops and twists, to get the girls. Four
        bachelors, four lovely ladies. And of course, there is singing and dancing,
        which is infectiously enjoyable. The film is just under two and a half hours,
        and includes an intermission. I exit the theatre, losing Krishna in the
        crowd, and head back. Have a peek at the trailer.</p>
    <p>I’m still not feeling 100%, and I think a lot of that is my anxiety regarding
        Indian sanitation and my general mistrust for every drop of liquid ormorsel of food I consume. But I do feel I’m getting the hang of India,
        though far later than other countries yet visited, and with only a few days
        left before I depart. But that sanitation issue remains a block, irresolvable. I
        find that it is such a fundamental thing, how do you have a nuclear arsenal
        and put satellites in space when people have shit in their streets? Is it
        poverty? Is it cultural? I can’t seem to get past it.</p>
    <p>Train for New Delhi tomorrow at dawn, I think I’m about ready. Gonna sign
        out early for tonight, I’ll let you know if I get up to any real fun mischief.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
