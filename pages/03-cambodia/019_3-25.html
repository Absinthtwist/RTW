        <h1>Day 19: Angkor Wat</h1>
        <h2>Sunday 25 March 2012</h2>
        <h3>Siem Reap, Cambodia</h3>
    <p>Slept in till about 0830 and headed downstairs to join Linda who had a
        head start on breakfast. We agree that when we go to Sihanoukville on
        Wednesday, taking a plane is preferable to the bus. Big difference in price,
        but it’s one hour vs ten hours. We also arrange for a private tour guide and
        tuk-tuk driver to take us to our reason for being here: Angkor Wat.</p>
    <p>Our driver arrives on time and we are on our way by 1030. It’s already
        around 90f, cool for this time of year, and rather humid. I decided to wear
        sandals today, shoes seem less practical in a country where you remove
        them often, and I figure it might be a good change for my feet. I regret that
        choice within a few hours, but it is what it is.</p>
    <p>I must make clear that this really and truly is the jungle. This giant
        complex, covering many square miles, was completely lost and forgotten for
        centuries. How is that possible?    </p>
        <p>The jungle. It’s been cleared back and some restoration has been done, but
            make no mistake: these are ruins. Truly amazing, beyond description,
            breath taking ruins. Straight out of an Indiana Jones movie.
            At different points in Angkor Wat’s history, it’s focus has shifted between
            Hinduism and Buddhism, though the original design was Hindu and the
            current slant is Buddhist. There are great long walls covered with intricate
            relief carvings depicting the epic stories of Rama and Krishna, and there are
            many many seated Buddhas, nearly all without heads. The heads wereremoved by treasure hunters through the years, quick profit and easier than
            carrying away the whole thing.</p>
        <p>After a few hours, we retreated to a nearby open-air restaurant of sorts,
            directly across from Angkor Wat. This place was recommended by our tour
            guide, and it was amazing.        </p>
    <p>Linda and I each had a fresh mango shake, and we each had a local chicken
        dish. Mine was a curry, I’m not sure what hers was, but they were both
        delicious. Not spicy like Thai food, but a similar experience in some ways.
        Worn out by the heat, we decide to take it easy, and at our request our guide
        takes us to an artisans’ workshop to look at local works. Truly beautiful, and
        I spend far more than I should, then I spend almost as much again to have
        it shipped home.    </p>        
    <p>A bit foolish and impulsive, but done is done. We were then taken to a
        reputable massage establishment, where we both got a one hour body
        massage. Being rather massage-naive, I was intrigued by the difference
        between my Japan massage and this one. I liked this one better, but it was
        less soft. It was rough, push and pull and contort. Alas that my dear friend
        Linda, who has had back problems in the past, seems to have tweaked
        something and is in some pain afterwards.    </p>
        <p>We head back to our hotel and try to rest her back and my feet, and a
            couple hours later, as the sun is setting, we decide to walk a bit. A local
            French restaurant is recommended to us but we fail to find it, and instead
            end up in a rather sub- par and out of place “Irish Pub.”
            I’m not exactly sure what makes it Irish, probably not the bad RnB cover
            music we are subjected to, no nor the menu. Best not to ask, I suppose.
            We walk back to our hotel through the busy streets, dodging tuk-tuks and
            motorcycles and enjoy a drink on the balcony before calling it a night.        </p>
        <p>Tomorrow, better shoes for me, and an earlier start with less sun, hopefully.
            There’s a great deal of Angkor Wat and it’s surroundings to explore.  </p>
        <p>Safe journey. </p>
