    <h1>Day 21: Siem Reap</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 27 March 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Siem Reap, Cambodia</h3>
    <p>Early start again, out the door by 0730. Alas, our guide, Thay, couldn’t
        make it today, though we still have our same driver. He seems a good,
        helpful fellow, and he does seem to speak English and we do communicate
        well, but I feel his English isn’t quite as far along as Thay’s. </p>
    <p>A lot more driving today, longer distances, and I develop a really good
        appreciation for the joy of riding through the country in a tuk-tuk,
        especially as our driver is so conscious of avoiding what bumps he can. It’s
        quite a pleasure. And if I have learned nothing else in Cambodia, it’s just
        how much weight a motorcycle is capable of carrying. I never would have
        imagined.    </p>
    <p>Our first stop of the day, at around 0830, was at the temple of Banteay Srei.
        While there are some similarities, this temple feels quite different, in ways
        not easy to articulate. Softer, more feminine. There seems a little more
        artistic flourish in the details, and the whole complex is smaller, with the
        main towers, even the doors are smaller, shrunken down, and I am
        reminded of a doll’s house. With the archer hero and the monkey warriors,
        it seems to me that this temple is in some way to the Hindu tale of Rama.
        As a bonus to make this temple memorable for me, in a pool at the entrance
        I saw my first real lotus flower. It was a special moment for me, so much
        focus in this beautiful little flower. It really is gorgeous.</p>
        <p>We are back on the road by 0930 and headed for what we have heard is
            quite a sight, the floating village. It’s quite a drive back into town then on
            beyond it. On the drive, the road seems to respond to my happiness at
            seeing a lotus as we pass fields and fields of lotuses.        </p>
        <p>All beautiful. We passed through low jungle, all sorts of very simple villages,
            very scrawny looking cattle, a few water buffalo, housed balanced very
            uncertainly on stilts at the side of an embanked road, entire villages on
            stilts, each looking ready to collapse with the next fair wind.  </p>
        <p>We reached the reception parking lot area of the floating village and had to
            pay two dollars. A little warning alarm went off in my head, but two bucks
            is not a big deal. But the large reception area, gift shops, this large spread…
            for a village so poor they couldn’t afford land and were forced to live on
            water? Hmmmmm…. Then we were told the two bucks was just to get in,
            that it will be another thirty dollars for the two of us. In Cambodia, thirty
            dollars is a lot of money. But we’ve come this far. Fine. Let’s go.  </p>
        <p>We are lead to a boat, just the two of us, our boat driver, and a teen- aged
            local for our guide. We ride on brown unwholesome smelling water up a
            river until we reach our floating village. The small Rickety houseboats, with
            tiny rafts moored to them with firewood and kitchen gardens, floating
            general stores, a floating school, even a floating basketball court, all very
            picturesque.        </p>
        <p>But the whole thing felt not right to Linda and I both, like someone was
            profiteering off of someone else’s misfortune without ever helping them.
            We discover that we have paid for a ninety minute tour, but we both decide
            we are quite done and ask to be driven back. </p>
        <p>Back with our own driver and tuk-tuk, we make the trek back into town. We
            make a quick shuffle to the post office to mail off our souvenirs, then are
            back by 1415 where we nap through the heat of the afternoon.    </p>
        <p>Showered and rested and more or less fresh, we are out the door by 1800
            and on our way – by car, no less – to the Smile of Angkor show. It looks less
            like traditional local dance, which sounds good to me, and more like a
            cheesy Vegas floor show. But there are advertisements for it everywhere,
            Linda expresses interest and I say what the hell. It could be fantastic fun.  </p>
        <p>Yeah, the show had some fantastic, talented, beautiful people, but was still
            pretty cheesy. First we were driven to a rather mediocre buffet, then on to
            the show. The Cambodian people have an amazing beauty and grace, I
            think I’ll just leave it at that.        </p>
        <p>Tomorrow back to the airport and on to Sihanoukville, to the beach.  </p>
        <p>Safe journey.        </p>
