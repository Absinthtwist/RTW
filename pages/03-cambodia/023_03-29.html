    <h1>Day 23: The Wild East</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 29 March 2012</h2>
    <h3>Sihanoukville, Cambodia</h3>
    <p>There’s a term I’ve heard before. I’ve known more or less what it means, but
        this is my first real exposure: “Island Time.”
        It’s a broad concept, taking in more than the obvious lack of a need for a
        watch. It’s the lack of regulation or strict rule. No shoes, no shirt, no
        problem. When we were having lunch, a guy at the next table lit up a huge
        jay without a care in the world.
        One of the ex-pats I spoke to here called this place “the wild wild east,” and
        he was quite right. Right now I am relaxing on a beach chair, in a wooden
        deck over surf and rocks, enjoying the dusk. </p>
    <p>Is there a railing on this deck? Don’t be silly. The sidewalk along the water
        will occasionally and abruptly end. At one point a staircase between two
        walkway levels consists of a tree-stump. Words like “bar” and “restaurant”
        are convenient but fail to adequatelydescribe the reality here. A truly amazing structure: part timber, part
        thatch, part corrugated iron, cement floors, simple wood and pillow
        couches and chairs. Walk bare foot, put your feet on the table… I took a nap
        on a couch while Linda read. It seems like most of the businesses here are
        owned by westerners. English, German, French, American, take your pick.
        The ones we’ve talked to seemed to want to escape the rat race. This
        certainly is a
        paradise, but a rough, untamed one. I got the sense that every ex-pat I
        spoke to was happy to talk and share, but they seemed to close off a bit
        when asked why they left their old countries. They all have stories, and I
        suspect more than a few of them are a little dark. Things they are getting
        away from, ghosts. In many ways, this does feel like the old west, at least to
        me. It is very very easy to understand why so many people find this so
        compelling. </p>
    <p>Tonight, like today, is about Island Time, about being present. Tomorrow
        looks to be no more adventurous, and for right now, that’s just fine. </p>
    <p>Safe journey! </p>
