    <h1>Day 24: Serendipity</h1>
    <h2>Friday 30 March 2012</h2>
    <h3>Sihanoukville, Cambodia</h3>
    <p> Today, once again, we lounged by the water, here on Serendipity Beach, and
        did nothing in particular. I got a massage by the waterside, and when
        masseuse aggressively tried sell me a man i-pedi, I said what the hell.   </p>
    <p> She even did the thread thing where they pluck hairs and erased my uni-
        brow. It felt rather silly, but when in Rome…</p>
    <p> The sun is just now setting. I can feel a little sunburn in my legs but nothing
        serious. Tomorrow we take a four-ish hour bus ride to Phnom Penh.</p>
    <p> As always, a tiny bit sad to leave, but much more excited to move forward
        than sad.   </p>
    <p>Here’s to hoping tomorrow’s bus has A/C </p>
    <p>Safe journey. </p>
