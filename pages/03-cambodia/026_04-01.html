    <h1>Day 26: April Fool's Day</h1>
    <h2>Sunday 1 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Phnom Penh, Cambodia to Bangkok, Thailand</h3>
    <p> I was so tempted to write up this long blog entry of total bullshit today. Had
        it planned out. Go down for a bite to eat, get sucked into a conversation
        with some fellow travelers. Go out for drinks with them, meet a girl with a
        twinkle in her eye. End up talking with locals about politics, which leads to
        the real fun when the police arrive and suddenly we’re all on the run. I
        thought about maybe giving myself a mild gunshot wound (maybe a
        shoulder, people in movies get shot in the shoulder and still seem to
        manage push-ups and climbing ladders, etc), but that might have been too
        far. Naturally, I would end up with the mysterious girl and a fade to black,
        then back to my hostel just in time to grab my bag and make my flight.</p>
    <p>Whew! That all just sounds like a lot of work, and really, it’s far more
        interesting to try a story like that in mid-May or something. Everyone
        expects something on April Fool’s Day, and the entire point, in my mind, is
        to catch you off guard and, if only for a moment, make you believe. So with
        all respect to this wonderful day dedicated to me, I reserve the right to be
        foolish whenever I like </p>
    <p>How many people can you squeeze onto a motorcycle? Four, at least! </p>
    <h3>1820: Phnom Penh International Airport. </h3>
    <p>A bit lame. My flight has been pushed back four hours. If I knew it would be
        pushed back this far, I’d have woken early and gone out, done more with
        the day. Aside from the palaces and museums, there’s a shooting range
        where you can fire a rocket launcher. And really, when will I get another
        shot at that? But here I sit, stuck in this airport. Truthfully, I knew this sort
        of thing was bound to happen. If this is as bad as it gets, then I am indeed
        fortunate: this is a short direct flight. No connections. This could have been
        much worse. </p>    
    <p>When I started this trip, my pack was just under thirty pounds, with me
        wearing my jacket. Right now, with my jacket stuffed inside, my pack
        weighs in just under twenty- four pounds. Makes a difference. I said good
        bye to my daypack and toiletries bag. I kept having to take all my liquids
        out for airport inspection anyway, so I’m just using the plastic bag. And in
        the places I am going, the daypack just says “rob me.” No thanks. </p>
    <p>I’ve picked up a new book. I was hoping to get the second Hunger Games
        book, but you take what you can get. Bangkok may do better in that
        department. What I got was a collection of fiction short stories simply
        entitled Bangkok Noir. I think the title says it all. I know when I was in
        Hong Kong I kept thinking that it was such an amazing film noir setting.
        Perfect. Beyond perfect. Let’s see if Bangkok makes a similar impression. </p>
    <p> Time for some overpriced airport food.</p>
    <p>Shiny Bangkok Airport </p>
    <p>Got into Bangkok and through customs by around 2145. The airport was
        quite big and what I saw was very pretty. It’s a fair distance out of town,
        and I suddenly decided I wanted to see if I could manage this without a taxi.
        This is just the sort of thing which perfectly exemplifies the benefit of
        traveling alone. 2200 and I want to get into town, not really sure how to do
        it. May need to walk a bit. Sounds like fun to me, but if I were traveling with
        someone else, I don’t think I’d suggest such a thing. Or if I did, I’d feel
        anxious about how they felt about it. But, with no one to please but myself,
        I started out. </p>
    <p> Metro train first. Easy, pleasant. Lots of English. The train only got me so
        far, and let me out at some sort of high end mall. I saw adverts for a
        Madame Tussaud’s near by. The place looked nice but empty, it was closing
        in on 2300 by this time so I started walking. The Thais, like the British,
        drive on the left side of the road, so I crossed over to facilitate catching a
        bus and started walking. I went ahead to check my position on my iPhone
        and confirmed that I absolutely was heading in the right direction, but that
        I had about another four kilometers to go. At this point, the streets weren’t
        bad, still reasonably upscale and safe looking, but I felt with the distance,
        the hour and the unknown area, best to give in and can it. I tried to tell thedriver where my hostel was, tried to show him on the map with little
        success, until I me tipped Khao San road, then it was
        No problem. Fast, safe and efficient.</p>
        <h3>2330</h3>
        <p>as I walked through the famed Khao San Road to my hostel and it was
            a blast. Just amazing. If it wasn’t the live music everywhere it was the life
            and the people, if it wasn’t the people, it was the colors and textures. And if
            not any of those, just cover your eyes and ears and take in the smells!!!
            Wonderful! </p>
        <p>Found my hostel a block away without incident. Clean and tidy and
            pleasant. Showrted forever. Slept like a rock </p>
        <p> Safe journey.</p>
