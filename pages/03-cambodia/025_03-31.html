    <h1>Day 25: Phnom Penh</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 31 March 2012</h2>
    <h3>Sihanoukville tp Phnom Penh, Cambodia</h3>
    
    <p>The bus to Phnom Penh, really, was nothing like I had feared. We were
        picked up in a van at 0930 and taken to the bus, parked in an alley. We
        hopped on with our luggage and were driven to a bus station where we
        changed to a different bus. </p>
    <p>This bus was reasonably comfortable, had something resembling air
        conditioning, and was moderately smooth on the road. Linda and I
        stretched out in different rows for more comfort. I think Linda actually had
        some thought that the four and a half hour drive time we were quoted
        would be accurate. I on the other hand have begun to see how things work
        around here and was ecstatic when we actually left on time, and not a bit
        shocked when we stepped off the bus in Phnom Penh six hours after
        starting. </p>
    <p>We grabbed a tuk-tuk and were off to my hostel, checked in with luggage
        secured. We grabbed a bite to eat there in the hostel and I was finally able
        to scratch my itch for western food with an actual pizza. I know, it sounds
        terrible of me, all this distance and I want American food. Hey, it’s a
        comfort thing. I think I’m good for a little while. </p>
    <p> We stretched our legs a bit around a temple and a market area, both
        pleasant but neither stunning. The immaculate ribbon of park along side
        the river was also quite pleasant.</p>
    <p> By this time the sky was darkening, and Linda decided to leave early for her
        plane. We parted ways with a big hug, then off she went in the tuk-tuk.</p>
    <p>Back to being solo again. I love Linda dearly, but I am glad. I am ready to be
        alone again. Tomorrow I head to Bangkok. </p>
    <p> Safe journey.</p>
