    <h1>Day 20: The Jungle, Continued</h1>
    <h2>Monday 26 March 2012</h2>
    <h3>Siem Reap, Cambodia</h3>

    <p>Awoke early today, and was on the road by 0700. Much cooler for the time
        being, and we take full advantage seeing some amazing temples today. This
        was all part of the larger Angkor Wat site, specifically Angkor Thom.
        Our guide was excited to tell us that Angelina Jolé was here filming Tomb
        Raider. That’s quite plausible: as we walk through the temple walls and see
        areas once encrusted with jewels, I can easily imagine Indiana Jones
        walking through here, and as I think that I find myself looking at the floor
        at the stones walk on, suddenly wary of booby-trap tiles.    </p>
    <p>The heat couldn’t stay away forever, so around 1100 we stop for lunch. Our
        guide pleasantly reminds us that for him, this is the cool time of year, some
        of the locals are actually wearing sweaters. We enjoy a great lunch again
        today, don’t ask me what it was, but it was delicious.</p>
    <p>I have to say, I have a great deal of faith in my guide, he has done very well
        for us. Guided us to amazing sights, only ever taken us to restaurants or
        merchants at our request, and the prices and quality have been beyond
        complaint. His name is Thay (pronounced Tay). </p>
    <p>After lunch, we once again go for a massage, two hours this time. We are
        paying top dollar, twice the street price for these massages, ten US dollars
        per hour, but quite good. My masseuse was quite shocked and amused by
        my height, i don’t think she gets paid by the square inch. It was quite
        pleasant, though she worked very hard on a knot in my back thigh. I confess
        I was surprised she could make me hurt that bad, but again, a very good
        massage.    </p>
    <p>After the massage, as with yesterday, we took it easy and napped a bit. U
        washed some undies in the sink, recharged my batteries. By 1800 the sun
        was heading down, and we looked again for the restaurant our guide had
        recommend, Indochine. We did find it, and while quite pretty, the food was
        a bit unremarkable.    </p>
    <p>After eating we walked a bit further and found a night market. It was like a
        cross between Pier One and Cost Plus World Market and a yard sale. Truly
        fantastic, all kinds of fantastic stuff at very
        reasonable prices. I don’t buy anything, but Linda does, and I am getting a
        feel for the whole haggling thing. It actually looks like fun if you have the
        right mindset going in.    </p>
        <p>We return to our room and talk into the night, watching the insects
            congregate around the electric light, and the geckos congregate to eat the
            insects. Circle of life. And as the insects start to eat me, I feel very certain
            whose side I am on then head in for the night.  </p>
        <p>Safe journey!        </p>
