    <h1>Day 22: Siem Reap to Sihanoukville</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 28 March 2012</h2>
    <h3>Siem Reap to Sihanoukville, Cambodia</h3>
    <p>We tried to sleep in today, but we were both awake and up by 0730.
        We packed up our things and went downstairs for our last breakfast in Siem
        Reap.    </p>
    <p>I feel pretty done here, ready to move on. I’m a bit surprised that three days
        can actually feel adequate. Mind, I could spend more time here, still so
        much to see. But I am ready to move on.    </p>
        <h3>1030        </h3>
    <p>Got our tickets and waiting for plane. They said our bags were too small to
        carry on, and as we were both taken by surprise by that, we neglected to
        lock our bags up. Linda is a bit nervous as she has all her money in that bag.
        Oh well, done is done. We can hope everyone is good and honest here. Or at
        least that they don’t find anything they want to take.  </p>
    <h3>1850</h3>
    <p>We arrived on time and were out of the airport and in a van by 1300. Took
        the drive to the beach and were let off to walk the rest. I got us walking the
        wrong direction but we eventually found our place. A bungalow on a hill on
        the beach. Perhaps three stories of stairs away from the water.    </p>
    <p>We drop off our stuff, make sure the A/C is good then we are off to find
        food. We see a place saying it has burgers and pizza and are tempted. We
        order a couple drinks – my piña colada tastes ok but us not frozen – and
        when the pizza comes it is quite a lesson. Funky thick bread and bizarre
        tomato sauce and a few bits of some unknown melted cheese. Quite
        interesting, but not pizza.    </p>    
    <p>We walk a bit, we lay out on beach chairs a bit. The beach here is filled with
        beach chairs and umbrellas. The narrow walkway lined with thatch roofed
        bars. Poverty is here too, with many people walking from place to place,selling their wares. Manicures and sunglasses appear to be big, though I
        find my attention grabbed by the squid- kabob lady. My favorite, of course,
        is the lady balancing a large dish of fresh fruit on her head as she walks
        about her way. We also see a number of amputees and persons with birth
        defects hoping for money. It’s hard: either you toughen up or get eaten
        alive. The decision to help or to keep walking is a difficult one, and quite
        personal.    </p>
    <p>I’m laying quite luxuriously in a hammock on the porch of my bungalow, in
        the dark, looking down at the lights of the bar down by the water as I wait
        for Linda to return from yet another massage. She said this was she
        intended to get a massage nearly every day while on this vacation, and she
        has kept her word. I can hear the unmistakable crackle of a fire from down
        below, and music. And of course, above it all, the haunting roll of the surf
        and the call of crickets. This is very beautiful. It will be hard for me to do
        nothing, but it really does seem to be the thing to do at this moment. I don’t
        expect my reports will be terribly interesting over the next couple days.
        Sorry, but that’s how it goes. I know I’m having a great time. here, still so
        much to see. But I am ready to move on. Bangkok next.    </p>
    <p>Safe journey.    </p>
