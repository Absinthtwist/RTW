    <h1>Day 105: The Great American Tribal
        Ritual</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 19 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Boston, United States of America</h3>  
 
 
    <p>So the game doesn’t start till 1900, but all the same, today is focused
        entirely around Fenway Park and the Boston Red Sox. We are awake and
        out the door by 0900, walking the two miles in no hurry whatever. Our
        direction is west today, quite different from yesterday, and we are treated to
        a new array of gorgeous historic buildings. We wander through a church
        here, a library there, enjoying the views.</p>
    <p>Around 1000 or so we stop at an Apple Store. Tom’s iPhone camera lens is
        a bit scratched, and no harm in asking if anything can be done. It takes a bit
        of time but our problem is favorably resolved, and we continue on our path.
        By around noon we are in sight of the great ballpark, and quite ready for
        lunch. We stop at Jerry Remmy’s bar and restaurant, where Tom spots Mr
        Remmy himself. Tom has to explain to me, a sports idiot, that Jerry Remmy
        is a former ball player and now sports celebrity. Tom has his baseball glove
        with him, and Mr Remmy is a good sport and signs the glove. For lunch I go
        a bit crazy, eating food like I haven’t in months, nachos and a huge burger.
        It’s amazing, but I am profoundly full: my body is no longer accustomed to
        this sort of thing.</p>
    <p>Our bellies full, we walk over to Fenway and take the guided tour of the
        ballpark. I may be a sports idiot, but I know enough to appreciate the
        beauty and charm and above all the American cultural significance of this
        ball park. The tour is great, our guide knowledgable and clearly feels very
        deeply about his park. We get a good walk around the seats, including
        taking a seat on the Green Monster itself.</p>
    <p>By 1539, the tour wraps up and we have a seat on the curb outside the park
        while we wait to be let in early to watch batting practice. Tom signed up forRed Sox Nation in anticipation of this, getting us a little more insight and
        time in the park. They let us in around 1640 and we are back on the big
        green wall watching the teams warm up. We get maybe forty minutes or so
        before it is time to move on.</p>
    <p>Coming up on 1745, we walk around to the opposite side of the park to
        some really good seats, a couple boxes back behind home plate, a bit to the
        right. We’re still pretty early and I’m sure the wait will be numbing, but
        watching the seats slowly fill, the vendors open, the park come to life, it’s
        not only compelling, it helps slow down my pace and get me ready for the
        game. Baseball is quite different from other major American sports, not as
        frantic. And baseball seems very different live compared to how it feels
        through a TV. It feels so much more correct live, so much easier to follow,
        so much more engaging. The first pitch is thrown at 1910, and the game
        begins.</p>
    <p>Really, just being here is the point. Being a part of the ritual, as compelling
        and exacting as any African tribal dance. You cheer when your team does
        well. You clap when the tribe claps, you stand when the tribe stands. This is
        about inclusion, and I don’t fight it. Just being here is enough, the fact that
        its really a good game is a fantastic bonus. A good three or four home runs,
        a close score, and the home team wins at the end with a big cheer. It’s a
        blast.</p>
    <p>The game wraps up around 2200, the streets filled to bursting with people
        walking everywhere, spilling out from the game, no doubt. We make the
        walk back, a bit quicker this time, reaching the hostel around 2300. The
        flight tomorrow departs at 0800, which means we should hit the airport
        around 0600 which means, with figuring out transport, we get a wake up
        call of 0445. The good news: this will be the last of this trip. It’s also the bad
        news though. The trip is just about done.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
