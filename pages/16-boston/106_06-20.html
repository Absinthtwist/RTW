    <h1>Day 106: The Last, The Longest</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 20 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Boston, United States of America</h3>  
 
    
    <p>So this is the last day of my journey. I return to Spokane to visit family for a
        few days, then back to Seattle and real life. It will be nice to rest in Spokane,
        but that is no journey. Today is my last travel day. And quite by chance,
        today is also the summer solstice, the longest day of the year. Quite
        auspicious, no doubt. And also by chance, today will be quite a long flight
        day. Not the longest, but still, eight and a half hours in the air, give or take.</p>
    <p>Up and out of the hostel by 0510, we retrace our steps and walk back to the
        bus/train station we were first dropped off at upon arriving in Boston. A
        short wait later we cram in like proverbial sardines beyond what I’d
        imagine this bus could actually carry, stuffed like something you’d see in
        the third world, then we are off to the airport.</p>
    <p>The security screening seems less organized and more annoying than I’m
        used to, and I find the removing of my shoes to just be funny. But by 0650
        we are at our gate, and by 0740 we are on the plane. Been far too long since
        I’ve seen that sort of perfect efficiency.</p>
    <p>We land in San Francisco at 1100. The flight was long but I’ve had worse
        and can’t really complain. We maneuver through the terminal, find our gate
        and have a seat. I can feel the impatience welling up in me, I just want to
        get going and be done. After an agonizingly long thirty minutes or so, we
        board without incident. My bag, which has always been carried on with only
        one exception, a tiny jet in Cambodia, is too small for the overhead bin. Try
        as I might to stuff, it shall not go. My impatience is ramping up, and I am
        about to surrender to having to check my bag. I take a seat, just to clear the
        isle and let pass the boarding passengers, and just to get it out of the way, I
        put my bag at my feet and shove it half under the seat. Good enough. I put
        my feet on top of my bag and the flight attendant never gives it a second
        look. So be it.</p>
    <p>We seem to taxi forever, but eventually we do lift into the air, and I feel
        relief. It is done, the last flight is away. The flight is about ninety minutes, I
        can deal with that. The battery on my iPhone is wasting away, but I say
        screw it and play away, both mindless solitaire and music, luxuries I tend to
        ration, but no point now. At last, without fanfare or drama, the plane
        touches down. I am one of the first out the door, pack over my shoulder,
        and I head outside to my ride home.</p>
    <p>And that’s pretty much that.</p>
    <p>Thanks for reading, I’ll post more soon enough.</p>
    <p>Safe journey! Tomorrow I sleep, and probably the next day too!</p>
