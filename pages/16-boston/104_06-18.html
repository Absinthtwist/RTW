    <h1>Day 104: Bunker Hill</h1>
    <h2>Monday 18 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Boston, United States of America</h3>  
 
    
    <p>Tom and I wake and set out around 0800, stopping to eat nthe rather
        unimpressive free breakfast at the hostel. We make our way first to Boston
        Commons, a lovely green park surrounded by city. We quickly start finding
        clues of history: monuments, statues, a red brick path embedded in the
        sidewalk marking Boston’s famous freedom trail.</p>
    <p>We pass through a fabulous collection of churches and old grave yards, past
        historic homes and neighborhoods, walking at our own pace,
        eavesdropping on tour guides when we can. We stand upon the spot
        marking the Boston Massacre around 1130, and decide to stop for lunch,
        agreeing on seafood. We take our time, enjoying a good lunch and good
        conversation, and move forward when ready.</p>
    <p>We cross a bridge over beautiful water, a marina packed with boats nearly
        beneath us, and move north. We pass Paul Revere’s home and a few more
        churches, and a fantastic neighborhood or two, and by 1300 or so we reach
        the end of the trail, Bunker Hill. There’s an obelisk monument at the top of
        the hill that neither of us feel compelled to climb. We take in the scenery a
        bit, and by 1400 we are walking back, at an even slower pace, taking our
        time and sparing our sore feet.</p>
    <p>By around 1600 we reach the hostel and decompress a bit before heading a
        few doors down to a fantastic looking nineteenth century pub where we
        grab dinner. I have a plate of delicious but heavy mac n’ cheese From therewe walk a bit more and grab a movie before making it back to the hostel
        around 2200 and calling it a day. Tomorrow: Fenway.</p>
