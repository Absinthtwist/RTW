    <h1>Day 101: A Light Day</h1>
    <h2>Friday 14 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Reykjavik, Iceland and points beyond</h3>  
    <p>It’s not as easy as I’d like to sleep in under these conditions. The sun is
        always trying to get into the room, a problem I am accustomed to, working
        nights, but I am out of practice just now. More of a problem are the other
        fifteen people in this huge dorm room with me. Typically you might have
        three to six people sharing a dorm room in a hostel, but this is a little more
        extreme. Further, and maybe I’m just seeing things from the wrong angle,
        but the vast majority of travelers here are the college crowd looking for fast
        action and lots of noise. Much less travel insight here. So I’m awake before
        0700, and after a shower and breakfast, I’m on my way at 0810, to change
        to a smaller bus which departs at 0900.</p>
    <p>The drive is about an hour, and we waste no time on preliminaries. The
        weather is gorgeous today, so I slip off my sweater and am trying on
        helmets within moments of arrival. There’s a brief inquiry about how much
        experience I have with horses, and I answer honestly that it’s been years
        and years, and only a tiny bit of experience even then. I am led to a horse, a
        truly beautiful dappled gray and white mare named Saga. She is bridled and
        I walk her back, then she is saddled and I am up. These are Icelandic
        horses, stouter and shorter by far than what I am accustomed to (Ha! Like
        I’m accustomed to horses!), but I’ve been told more than once to NOT call
        this animal a pony. Icelanders love their horses very much. But small or no,I sit in the saddle comfortably enough , and Saga doesn’t seem to mind.
        There are perhaps a dozen or so of us, and once everyone is mounted, away
        we go.</p>
    <p>Initially this is quite a mild yet pleasant affair, the horses walking slowly in
        single file down a path along side a small river. The landscape around is is
        mind-blowingly beautiful, with green rolling hills dotted with lots and lots
        of those Alaskan wild flower I mentioned yesterday, plus some yellow
        flowers for balance.</p>
    <p>After a while, we reach a spot with a fantastic view of a waterfall. Nothing
        like yesterday, but still great. We all dismount and let the horses cool a bit.
        Our guide then explains that we will be dividing into two groups, one to
        maintain a mellow pace back to our starting pace, and another group to go
        at a canter or gallop. Now, I know I’m way out of my depth, but screw it, I’m
        wearing a helmet, and I didn’t come all this way to walk (funny the things I
        absolutely must do and the things I absolutely will not do). So I join the fast
        group, asking one of the experienced riders for a fifteen second course on
        how to ride a horse at speed. I nod as she explains what she can, then we
        are off. A good canter right from the start, slowing at river crossings, and
        opening up on the straight even parts of the path. One thing that surprises
        me is that even though my horse is the one running, I still feel like this is a
        work-out. It takes me a bit to get a sense of the rhythm, when to put some
        weight in my seat and when to put it all in my heels, when to sit straight (all
        the time, I think) and when to lean forward (like you see in the movies-
        never. Maybe I’m not going fast enough or something). at one point I’m at a
        good canter and still falling behind, so I try to get Saga to open up a bit and
        catch up with the others. She’s not having any of it. We hold our pace, and I
        defer to her wisdom in this manner. That’s the huge difference over a car or
        motorcycle. A car will go right over a cliff if you let it, but the horse may
        know more about that road than you do, and is worth listening to. Whether
        she held back because she knew I’m not that great a rider or because she
        was tired after carrying such a heavy guy, I don’t know. Either way, wemake it back to the stables at around 1215, and I take the saddle and bridle
        off my now sweaty horse and lead her to her corral to chill out.</p>
    <p>I’m just taking it all in when the next bus comes to speed us on to our next
        adventure. I don’t think anything can top this, but away I go all the same.
        Back we are taken to the main office, where again we switch buses. Another
        hour’s ride through moss covered volcanic rock of the most amazing craggy
        textures. Great boulders split in half. Fields of little rocks like bumpy skin,
        all layered over by green or ash-gray lichen. At 1400 we reach our
        destination, the Blue Lagoon.</p>
    <p>The pools of water are not so much blue as milky white, and the water is
        pleasantly warm to the touch. The black rocks are chalky white where they
        meet the water. There is a huge spa center here for experiencing the waters
        and being pampered. Turns out my tour gets me to the water but not in the
        water. The price of general entrance and the use of a towel is US$50. Like I
        was saying about things I absolutely must do and things I won’t. I’m not
        paying $50 for a warm bath no matter what color the water is. It seems only
        yesterday that I was in Cambodia grumbling when the price of a one hour
        massage went from US$6 to US$8. I shudder to think what a one hour
        massage would cost here. I can step out and sit by the pool, and I stick a
        hand in to feel its warmth. I ask myself, will I regret walking away from
        this? You can never tell, but I doubt it. And really, I gotta live in the now.
        What I may or may not regret can influence my decisions, but it shouldn’t
        make the choice for me. There are buses leaving at intervals, I catch the
        next one, no regret yet.</p>
    <p>Interesting: I’m at a crosswalk, the driver slows, and she seems slightly
        annoyed that I’m not already crossing. That I’m not already taking this
        obvious thing, the crosswalk, for granted and getting across and out of her
        way. I see now that the humble crosswalk is a token of civilization, and I
        pray I NEVER take it for granted. For so much of the world the crosswalk is
        an abstraction, and you take your life in your hands with every crossing. I
        cross the street and give the driver a grateful wave.</p>
    <p>By the way, you may have noticed a slight dip in my photo quality and
        quantity. The gizmo I use to move pics from my real camera to my iPhone
        (and from thence out up to the web to you good souls) is not functioning.
        The pictures seem fine, but we’ll have to wait until I get back to my
        MacBook before we get a good look at them. Life goes on.</p>
    <p>I’m sitting in a small square or plaza where a lady is placing the finishing
        touches to a large image of a Walkman and two speakers, all made of
        different colored duct tape. It’s quite large, dance floor size I suppose.
        Someone is next to her with a table and a DJ setup and a pair of large (real
        not duct tape) speakers blasting catchy dance music. I have a seat and
        watch.</p>
    <p>I finish the day in a not-so-exciting way. A load of laundry, presumably my
        last of this journey, and some surprisingly good pizza. Tomorrow, the south
        coast.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
