    <h1>Day 102: The Coast</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 16 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Reykjavik, Iceland</h3>  
    <p>I set out early today. And rather than over-paying for breakfast and waiting
        for the bus, I just start walking. I find a small grocery store close to my bus
        station and by 0730 I am sitting down and eating a baguette. A couple here
        and there walk down the street, beers in their hands, dressed for a night
        out. The duct tape plaza I saw last night is a filthy mess, filled with food
        wrappers and empty booze containers. Must have been a swinging party.</p>
    <p>I get on to my bus and we are on our way by 0800. We pass vast fields of
        undulating stone, like water frozen in mid-boil, thick with lichen. Just miles
        and miles of this, testament to the island’s volcanic power. Our guide tells a
        story of when the people of Iceland, who once worshiped the Norse gods
        like Thor and Odin, made the political decision to switch to Christianity.
        Shortly after that, one of the volcanoes erupted, spewing lava. Someone
        stated that the old gods were angry at their betrayal, to which someone else
        pointed out that the whole island is volcanic, what were the gods mad at all
        the other times? The guide also tells a curious tale of how a great cloud of
        volcanic ash, like the one that stopped flights in Europe a couple years ago,
        spread to France giving them a horrible crop, which helped trigger the
        frustrated and starving French to overthrow their government. A volcano
        contributing to the French Revolution, a perspective I’d not heard.</p>
    <p>At 1030 we stop and have a look at a waterfall. Not as huge and powerful as
        the one I saw two days ago, but this one I get to experience from the ground
        level, the river it pours into at my feet. It’s quite a different experience.
        Pretty amazing.</p>
    <p>We pile back into the bus and keep driving. We’ll be crossing the entire
        south coast of Iceland and back before the day is done, so no time to waste.
        It’s more than a little frustrating, and I hope that my next trip affords me
        the chance to rent a car and move at my own pace. I could spend a few days
        taking this very same trip and consider the time well spent.</p>
    <p>Oh, sidebar: that flower I mentioned before, it’s called the Alaskan Lupine,
        and I see miles of it. The soil here is sandy and flies away easily, the Lupine
        was brought in to grab the soil and reduce erosion. There are miles and
        miles of it. It would be a little disturbing if it weren’t do pretty. Parts of
        Iceland could easily pass for Montana, other parts could pass for Ireland.
        But a great deal of it just looks like another planet, which is part of the
        appeal.</p>
    <p>At 1300 we stop for a simple lunch, I have fish gratin and potatoes, then
        right back on the bus. By 1430 we reach our main destination: Jokulsarlon
        Glacier Lagoon. Astounding mountains with a great sheet of ice between
        them: glaciers. We come to a large lagoon of milky blue water from the base
        of the mountains stretching to the edge of the land. The earth narrows arou
        d the lagoon leaving a small channel or river connecting to the sea. We
        cross a bridge over this and come to this very cold looking water, covered
        with fantastic chunks of ice. Some of the ice is white, some of it blue. Some
        of it has streaks of black marbling, either in swirls or in precise ruler-
        straight lines: ash from the volcanoes, settled into the glacier in layers over
        hundreds of years. We hop into a WWII era truck-boat combo and drive to
        the water then keep driving into and over the water around these fantastic
        icebergs. Our guide grabs a piece of crystal clear ice and chops us all a bit of
        thousand year old ice for a taste. Terns fly over our heads, having migrated
        all the way from South Africa to breed here. They must be tired. And of
        course we see a few seals lounging about, as relaxed as you please. If you
        can handle the cold, which they can, that sure is the life.</p>
    <p>By 1600 we are back on the road for more eternal driving. The wide
        expanses of grasslands are frequented by sheep, wandering at will, no one
        watching them. Not much in the way of predators here, nearly all theanimals on Iceland were imported from Scandinavia, and the wolf was not
        included in that number. As the winter approaches, all the sheep are
        rounded up by their owners, who set out in groups on horseback.
        Apparently it’s s big festive to-do.</p>
    <p>At 1900 we stop in another small village for dinner. It’s raining now, but
        traces of fresh snow are still visible. Snow in June. I grab a burger and
        watch the locals move through what must be the best place for miles and
        miles. Rumors of the fantastic beauty of Icelandic women are not
        misplaced.</p>
    <p>Soon enough we are back on the road, the sun shining through the clouds
        here and there. We pass more lava rock fields, and fields of green grass
        dotted with large stones. The guide explains the folklore that stones like
        these are trolls caught in the light of the sun and petrified. All I can think of
        is Bilbo Baggins.</p>
    <p>We stop for another waterfall, and any chance of the charm wearing off is
        evaporated by the opportunity to walk behind the falling water. I bundle up
        as best I can and make peace with an inevitable soaking, then march out to
        the water. I take what pictures I can – with my waterproof camera so you’ll
        have to wait for results – get as soaked as I imagined, and return to my seat
        on the bus with a smile.</p>
    <p>It’s still a ride back to town, and I make it back to my hostel by around
        2300, the sun low but still quite bright. Tomorrow I return to the United
        States, flying to my last stop on this trip. I have mixed feelings about this,
        but mostly I am anxious to move forward on to the next adventure.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
