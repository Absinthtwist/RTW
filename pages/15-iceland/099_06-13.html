    <h1>Day 99: A Light Day</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 13 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Reykjavik, Iceland</h3>  
    <p>I’m awake and up by 0730, despite my intentions to sleep in. I start my day
        once again with laundry, and finally, by 1055, I am out the door.</p>
    <p>Reykjavik is a mellow town of less than two hundred thousand. Of course,
        all of Iceland has three hundred and twenty thousand people, that’s like one
        city block in India. Incidentally, the Indian Embassy is across the street
        from my hostel in what can only be called a strip mall. Things are a little
        more laid back here.</p>
    <p>Reykjavik has its charm, to be sure, but it’s not the city that captures one’s
        eye, it’s the bright blue sky, the deep indigo of the bay, and the rocky hills at
        the horizon. The architecture is pragmatic, sensible, with a few stand-out
        moments. There’s a cathedral with a great tower, looks to have been built in
        the twentieth century, a bit of a rocket-ship appearance to it. The people, as
        if answering all my best hopes, all carry a hint of that Viking blood, healthy
        and active in appearance. The locals are dressed in tee shirts and perhaps
        even shorts, while we tourists bundle in coats against the 45 f weather. And
        the sound of the Icelandic language is fantastic: anything said by anyone
        seems to carry images of coastal raids and horned helms (at least to me).I stop for a bite to eat and a bit stunned by the island prices. I was warned
        that most travelers would do best to stick with fast food, and I understand
        now. All the same, I order a bowl of goulash, a soup of lamb and vegetables
        and rice in a broth served with a slice of delicious bread. But yeah, I see fast
        food a lot in my future for the next couple days. Oh well.</p>

    <p>I keeping walking through the town until I reach the Perlan at 1400, a
        museum of sorts, made with life-size recreations and scenes with
        headphone explanations imparting a basic history of Iceland up to around
        the sixteenth century. It’s pleasantly entertaining and informative, certainly
        more than I knew coming in, and excellently done. The potential with this
        setup to be profoundly cheesy is always high, but with a dash of wit and
        good theatre, they pull it off. I would say its over-priced, but everything is
        over-priced here, so it doesn’t particularly stand out.</p>
    <p>I head generally back toward the center of town, toward the bay. After a few
        disasters with a small compass (that I no longer carry), I started using
        shadows to give a general sense of direction when walking. Rules are a bit
        different up here in Iceland. Shadows that should be pointing mostly east
        are point almost directly north. Good thing I know where I am. I make it to
        my own neighborhood at around 1530 and find that my super-expensive
        soup has already worn off. I accept my fate and stop for a passable soft taco
        before deciding to just hang out and charge everything up. Tomorrow my
        Iceland adventure begins in earnest.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
