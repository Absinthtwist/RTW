    <h1>Day 100: Geysir and Gullfoss</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 14 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Reykjavik, Iceland and points beyond</h3>  
    <p>In one week this journey will be over. Sobering thought.</p>
    <p>I’m awake before 0700 and pay too much for a modest breakfast. It’s filling,
        and that’s enough. I stretch and relax as I wait for my ride. I am picked up
        on time at 0800, and after a visit to the main office, a full bus departs at
        0840.</p>
    <p>We pass through some amazing country. A few rolling hills, punctuated
        with undulating flats and mountains. Much of it is grassy, covered with
        beautiful blue wildflowers which I’m told were introduced from Alaska,
        with sheep and stout horses grazing occasionally. Along the narrow road is
        a large metal pipe leading back to town, coming from up in the hills. The
        pipes are part of the island’s geothermal energy system, converting natural
        steam into electricity and using the near-boiling water under the ground to
        warm homes and heat purified waters for showers. I should add the shower
        water has a faint sulfurous odor. There are clumps of trees here and there,
        more imported than indigenous. Our tour guid tells us an old Icelandic
        joke: what do you do if you get lost in an Icelandic forest? You stand up. It’s
        apt: most of the trees are pretty short, but anything you can do to protect
        the thin soil from blowing away.</p>
    <p>Around 1000 we stop or Thingvellir, the site of Icelandic government for
        centuries, from the ninth or tenth century up until a hundred and fifty years
        ago. Two weeks of every year in June, people would gather from all around,
        making a festival out of it, no doubt. The chosen leaders would gather and
        discuss and do the business of governance. There was even one man whose
        job it was to recite aloud all the laws of the land at these gatherings, taking
        three years to complete the cycle. Iceland was an oral culture for quite a
        long time. There were no buildings assembled here. No parliament, no
        markets or palaces. Just a lovely patch of earth to which they all came.
        Those were the days.</p>
    <p>Fascinating sidebar: as foreign as the Icelandic language sounds, there are
        moments when it is amazingly familiar, and I am suddenly aware that
        Icelandic and English have a common ancestor. Many common words.</p>
    <p>We move on, continuing through amazing lands, over gorges and oceans of
        rock. This is the meeting point of tectonic plates which are slowly drifting
        apart, which goes a long way toward explaining that which makes Iceland
        so special: it’s confounding geology. Cool air and hot springs, entire fields,
        not of grass but of thick lichen. Volcanos, and of course, geysers. At 1215 we
        stop to see Gullfoss, the Golden Falls. Perhaps the most beautiful waterfall I
        have seen. And by 1400 we are there to see the original Geysir, the source of
        the word itself. Apparently, the great Geysir is retired now, but he has many
        brothers and sisters, one blowing about every three or four minutes a good
        thirty yards into the sky, belching a wall of steam out behind it. Several
        little geysers gurgle and bubble and steam all over the area. It’s gorgeous.</p>
    <p>We continue through the startling landscape, in turns alien then familiar
        and charming, stopping to see a few sights here and there, even exploring a
        geothermal power plant. Aside from a profound amount of strong smelling
        steam and lots of large pipes, there’s really not much to see at a geothermal
        power plant, but it’s still worthy of a look-see.</p>
    <p>We make it back to town before 1800, and I grab a quick bite before
        heading in to charge my camera back up. Everyone else is planning on a
        night out, but at ten bucks a beer, I’m just not feeling it. The bar scene
        seldom appeals to me anyway.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
