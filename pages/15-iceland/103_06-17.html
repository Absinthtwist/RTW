    <h1>Day 103: The Land Of The Free</h1>
    <h2>Sunday 17 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Reykjavik, Iceland to Boston, United States of America</h3>  
    <p>I wake and shower, and am checked out of the hostel by 0900. I hang out in
        the common area for the time being, emptying my pack and reloading it
        carefully. I am stuffed to the brim with things I have purchased, but see nopoint in mailing them at this late hour. I relax and do a little reading, aside
        from travel, I intend to keep today light.</p>
    <p>I head out around 1200 and grab some pizza, really very good, then walk
        through the center of town which is surprisingly crowded. Every now and
        then I’ll see a woman or a girl in traditional dress, and there are Icelandic
        flags flying about. I make a quick stop to secure my ride to the airport and
        ask what the occasion is. Today, it would appear, is the Icelandic
        Independence Day. What a treat! I walk around the crowded square a bit,
        stopping for a coffee, then catch my 1430 bus and am on my way.</p>
    <p>I reach the airport to check in by 1530 and secure a boarding pass but with
        no seat assignment: the plane is full and I am on stand-by. This makes me
        nervous, but the man at the desk assures me I’ll be on the plane. Just for
        curiosity I weigh my pack, which comes in at 15.5kg, nearly 6kg of souvenirs
        and other crap. I walk to the gate and fish my way through the crowds. I sit
        and wait a bit. When I stand, a stranger taps me and points to my wallet on
        the floor near where I was sitting. People can be cool, quite often from what
        I’ve seen.</p>
    <p>I finally secure a boarding pass with a seat and relax. I don’t mind not being
        the first on the plane, so long as I have a reserved seat. It takes them longer
        than expected to let people board, and at one point I do believe they were
        actually taking bags off the plane. We are, however, eventually let to board
        and all is well. My seat is right at the exit if the plane. First to disembark
        and with six feet of leg room. I can’t complain. As the plane takes off, I
        suddenly wonder if the baggage ever got put back on the plane, and I feel
        quite grateful that I don’t check my bag.</p>
    <p>On the flight I watch a movie, “The Way” with Martin Sheen, seems
        appropriate. About a man walking the Camino, to Santiago de Compostela.
        It’s a pilgrim trail one walks, across northern Spain mostly, though people
        often start in France. Walking typically takes a month or more. Quite a
        good film. And again, it seemed appropriate, especially as my journey is
        coming toward its end. One more city.</p>
    <p>Wheels down by 1900. I am to meet my friend, Tom, who is also flying in to
        Logan. We’re to hang out in Boston and catch a Red Sox game in Fenway.
        There’s a little confusion on my part on which plane he’s on, I thought hewas meant to arrive before me, but by 2030 it’s all sorted out and we are
        heading by bus toward downtown and our hostel.</p>
    <p>The bus ride is a straight-forward, and we walk the last half-mile or so. It’s
        nice to be back in a big city, one where everyone speaks English. We drop
        our bags off at the hostel and grab a late dinner around 2200, a couple of
        sandwiches from Panera, and call it a night. Tomorrow: Freedom Trail.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
