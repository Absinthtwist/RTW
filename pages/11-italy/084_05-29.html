    <h1>Day 84: The Holy See</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 29 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Rome, Italy</h3>   
  
    <p>The line to the Vatican Museum is the stuff of legend, so I purchased a tour
        package to skip the line. Tour starts at 0900, so I’m up and out the door by
        0730 and walking the three and a half kilometers to the Holy See.</p>
    <p>I don’t stop for distractions this morning as I did the other day, and soon
        enough I’m at the foot of the Ponte Sant Angelo. All is quiet at this hour, a
        few people here and there. Not so many tourists. Today I make the walk I
        declined to make on sunday, west, into Bernini’s glorious Saint Peter’s
        Square. I pause for a few minutes, luxuriating in the beauty and near-
        emptiness of it. It won’t be empty long.</p>
    <p>I follow the edge of the wall around the Vatican and find my tour group
        meeting point. I’m given a radio headset so the guide won’t have to shout,
        and by 0850, we are moving. We walk along the wall to the door to the
        museum, past a long line. There are some frustrating delays as we go
        through security and out guide sorts out buying our tickets, but by 0930 we
        are moving through the museum. I feel very uncomfortable with the group
        dynamic in here as this tour is obviously tailored for people who are here
        mostly to see the Sistine Chapel and don’t mind a breeze through the rest of
        the museum. This museum is more than world class, it’s galactic class, this
        is one of the best in the world. Better even than the Uffizi in Florence, or
        any museum I’ve seen on this trip. I don’t want to “breeze through.” Truth
        told, to avoid burn out and not take all year, I do tend to move fast in
        museums, but I like to stop as long as I wish at my own discretion. It angers
        me when we rush past something amazing I want to stop at.</p>
    <p>But anyway, she does stop at the big important things. We stop, for
        example, at the Laocoon, a true masterpiece I am pleased to see. It’s a
        dramatic moment from Homer’s Iliad. When the Greeks bring the TrojanHorse to the door of Troy, the Trojans all think it’s fantastic. Only one man
        smelled trouble, and he spoke out. But the gods were against him and set a
        snake to kill him and his family. In the sculpture we see the man and his
        two children entwined in the twisting pretzel-like coils of the snake. What is
        most over-powering, however, is the contorted shapes of their bodies as
        they try to escape, and far more, the looks of agony and horror, so stark, so
        real, bursting from their faces, the children looking up to their father for
        help that cannot come. It’s amazing.</p>
    <p>I remember first seeing pictures of this powerful and emotional sculpture,
        back in my art history school days, and was sure on first sight that it was
        Michelangelo. Well, I was wrong. It’s ancient Greek (we think- it could be
        Roman). The story I was told was that Michelangelo was present in the
        Vatican when this statue was discovered and brought in and that he was
        blown away. You can see how he learned from this piece, it’s emotion, it’s
        physical presence. This is why I come to places like this.</p>
    <p>I couple of rooms down we see the remnant of an old Greek statue, no head,
        no arms to speak of, legs only to the knee. This is called the Belvedere
        Torso. While so much may be missing, what is left is damn good. And
        apparently, Michelangelo, also impressed, copied this torso exactly, in every
        detail, just adding the rest of the body, when he painted Christ on the back
        wall of the Sistine Chapel.</p>
    <p>I know I mention Michelangelo a great deal, it’s worth noting that I do love
        Da Vinci as well, and I think Da Vinci would have made a more entertaining
        dinner guest and s dearer friend with wiser life counsel, and I adore his art,
        but Michelangelo, whom I think would probably have been miserable to
        know in life, remains, in my mind anyway, the vastly greater artist. Painter,
        architect, and above all sculptor, all art he touched he seemed to be
        transcendent at. But again, Da Vinci was, in my ill informed humble
        opinion, a far more compelling man, the one I would want as my friend.
        One man made art his life, the other made life his art.</p>
    <p>Anyway, we keep flying past masterpieces until at last we come to the
        Pope’s private chapel at last. We are all reminded several times, no
        photographs. We are told this is because it is a church, yet we can take all
        the photos we want in Saint Peter’s Basilica. There’s a hint of insincinserity
        in this which grates me, but it’s their place, their rules. It’s a privilege to be
        here, regardless.</p>
    <p>The chapel is actually rather large, and every inch of it is painted. Twenty
        years was spent cleaning and restoring this treasure, and a few small
        squares have been left unrestored for comparison. It’s hard to imagine how
        people could have seen enough to recognize even this beauty, looking at
        that near-black square that represents what this looked like thirty years
        ago. The colors here are so stunning, the images so profound. What no
        photo in any book I have ever seen has ever conveyed to me, what comes as
        such a surprise, is how Michelangelo’s figures spring from the walls.
        Looking up, I honestly have to remind myself that all of this is painted, that
        while it may look three dimentional, there are in fact no sculptures on the
        ceiling. The stunning figures, so strong and lifelike, the powerful colors with
        such striking contrast, one over the other, all build to make you see in three
        dimensions rather than flat images. Few artists have captured this. And of
        course, the brilliance of Michelangelo, which graces the ceiling and real
        wall, is not alone. The walls are are richly decorated as well, by several great
        artists, including Botticelli, whose Birth of Venus I saw just a few days ago.
        There is so much in this room to speak of: the Sibyls and Prophets, Jonah
        as the bridge from Old to New Testament, the great iconic image of God
        giving Adam the spark of life, the stunning image of God separating
        darkness from light. But I just can’t. Just… go see it, then we’ll talk.</p>
    <p>At this point, about 1100, my tour guide announces that we are about the
        leave the museum to move on to Saint Peter’s Basilica. And that’s as far as
        our time together goes. I politely hand her back her radio headset and am
        on my way. No way I’m exiting this museum just yet. I go on to see
        masterpieces from the Classical era all the way up to the modern, from
        Raphael to Salvador Dali. There’s even a Van Gogh here, and a Matisse. The
        modern art section does feel a bit limited, I suppose, as much of the art of
        the last two hundred years has been secular, much of it has also been rather
        ambivalent regarding the Church. None of that here. I think my favorite, or
        one of my favorites anyway, is the School of Athens, by Raphael. Quite
        lovely, perfectly sums up so much of the Renaissance, and always seems to
        make me happy.</p>
    <p>By 1500, I’ve seen as much as I can and feel I’ve done a pretty good job. I’m
        pretty worn out, museums can actually be quite tiring. I take a brief break
        and head back over to Saint Peter’s Basilica, which, as expected, is quite
        crowded. A rather long line to enter the Basilica extends nearly out of thesquare, so I take my place and wait. By 1600 I am through security and
        entering the grand cathedral itself.</p>
    <p>I have to be honest. While I try not to have expectations or make
        comparisons, it does still happen. This church is larger, grander, richer,
        more perfect and beautiful than any other church I have ever been in to, but
        all the same I am left a little cold. There seems to be a lot more here to do
        with popes than with God. A great deal more energy seems focused on self
        aggrandizement and self congratulations, and less on love and devotion.
        Piety seems secondary here. No doubt a great many would profoundly
        disagree with me, but all the same… For all the gold and marble, for all the
        vast size and great art, I’d take the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in a
        heartbeat. As a candle to the sun is this place to that, for all it’s grandness.
        Just saying.</p>
    <p>Off to the right chapel is one of the art works I was most looking forward to.
        Alas that it is behind glass and railings, and is a good ten meters or more
        away: la Pieta, by, of course, Michelangelo. Even at this distance, the power
        of the work is unmistakable. This image of of the Virgin Mary with her
        lifeless adult son laying in her lap, her face serene. The whole piece evokes
        so much for me. There are many other sculptures here, many of them quite
        lovely, but not on such a level as that.</p>
    <p>After about forty-five minutes I am ready to head to the dome, which, like
        the Duomo in Florence, is open to the public. One advantage, for a couple
        extra Euros, you can take the elevator – no joke – to the base of the dome.
        Well, I am quite pleased to take that elevator, which gets me right as
        promised to the base of the dome. It’s hard not to compare with the
        Duomo, which, with it’s striking frescoes, was more impressive. From here
        the stair begin and keep coming and coming, till at last the top is reached.
        The views are every bit as lovely now as they were for me on Sunday at the
        top of Castel Sant’ Angelo, though this is taller by far. By 1715 I’m on my
        way back down, where I find myself back in the Basilica. I wander a bit
        more, then by 1745 I am exiting.</p>
    <p>I grab a cab, deciding to spoil myself with a mindless meal of mediocre
        American food, sort of a break for me. Always on duty as a traveler, a coke
        and a burger is like a day off. Actually it’s a Pepsi and a pulled pork
        sandwich, but the theory applies all the same. I’m back I’m my hostel by
        1900, then back out again, my dirty clothes under my arm. I may beexhausted, but my desire for clean clothes exceeds my fatigue. It’s almost
        two kilometers each way, and I’m back home by 2200 and ready for bed.
        Tomorrow, no clue. I’m sleeping in if I can. Mail, I should mail some stuff
        home.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
