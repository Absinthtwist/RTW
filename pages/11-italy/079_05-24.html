    <h1>Day 79: Beautiful Florence</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 24 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Florence, Italy</h3>   
    <p>Out the door by 0800 and I look to my right and I can see the Campinale,
        the bell tower of Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore, one of the greatest
        cathedrals on Earth. More popularly known as il Duomo. The huge dome
        was quite an achievement, and it quite impressive. When the church was
        built, without a top, or so the story goes, a general competition was issued
        and this dome and it’s maker, Brunelleschi, won the day. Just seeing it
        there a hundred yards from my door is amazing.</p>
    <p>I make the walk and walk a great big loop around the huge cathedral. The
        bell tower and the baptistery are both separate buildings, I’m not sure why.
        The external walls of the cathedral are very ornate, in differing colors of
        marble.</p>
    <p>Eventually, I come to a door, and it’s up to the Duomo itself, so I get in the
        short line and in I go. The stairs seem to go forever, then more stairs, and
        still more stairs, then you come out, overlooking the interior of the
        cathedral from on high, at the base of the great dome, richly frescoed,
        curving up far above me. The images above start with obvious allusions to
        Dante’s work, vivid images of Hell including a devil with three mouths, each
        chewing on a traitor. Above we see Heavenly images, saints and angels.
        Lovely. The tremendous height and open space, I don’t mind saying, make
        me a bit nervous. Jumping out of a plane? Been, done, not scary. But this
        unnerves me.</p>
    <p>Well, no point in stopping now. I walk around the rim of the dome, through
        a door and find more stairs going up. These stairs soon start sloping
        inward, toward the top of the dome. After climbing and climbing, finally I
        step out onto the top of the great Duomo, high over the city of Florence.
        This sort of height doesn’t bother me one bit. There’s a fine haze in the air,
        almost overcast in the distance. The red-orange rooftops spread out in
        every direction. I soak it up for several minutes, then begin the inevitable
        trek back down. At the very bottom, I get a better glimpse of the cathedral’s
        interior. It’s rather restrained compared to its ostentatious exterior.</p>
    <p>I exit the cathedral and make my way through the plaza to the Duomo
        museum, which came with my ticket. The museum is fantastic, with several
        masterpieces, by some of the greats. A Michelangelo Pieta, which the
        master made for his own monument but rejected as imperfect. Few could
        dare to aspire to such imperfection.</p>
    <p>After this museum, I stop long enough to pick up the Firenze Card, which I
        purchased in the States. It’s a good deal, I recommend it. For €50, you get a
        72 hour pass for all the buses, and entry into nearly every museum and
        church, skipping the often formidable lines.</p>
    <p>I put it to use right away at the Accademia, which I discover is a mere thirty
        yards from my hostel’s door, just going the other way. Alas, no photos here.
        I walk past the huge line and go in after a two minute wait, passing through
        security of course. This gallery contains many beautiful works, but let’s be
        honest, people come here to see one thing only: Michelangelo’s David. And
        really, it is that good. It stands at the end of a long hall, in pride of place,
        the hall lined with unfinished works by the master stretching forth from
        their marble. There are many images of David facing Goliath, some with
        David triumphant, the head of his enemy at his feet. I’ve even seen one in
        the moment of action, the sling in motion, the stone about to fly. But this
        David is, to me, far and away the greatest. It is not the moment of victory,
        nor the moment of action. It is the moment of contemplation. His physical
        strength is shown, surely, but what stands out most is the focus and
        concentration on his face. I can almost here him thinking as he looks at his
        opponent: I can take him. This embodies all of what the Renaissance stood
        for: action yes, beauty also yes, but mote: grace through reason, measured
        thought. This statue was meant to stand elsewhere, outdoors, but here it is,
        far to precious to be left to the elements. Fine cracks are starting to appear.</p>
    <p>The rest of the gallery is also lovely, of course, but what can compare? Most
        of the works are of the same or similar era, but here and there are bits of
        modern art. Ah, modern art, what can I say? I love art as I love my own
        soul, but feel quite cold about most modern art. To me, seeing modern art is
        like running into your high school sweetheart. Where once she was about
        beauty and love and wit and courage, now she has a mohawk and facial
        tattoos and surgically implanted cat whiskers. I don’t know, maybe this is
        beautiful too, but I don’t see it. I hope this is a phase. Not that modern art
        should be a pandering whore, which sometimes seems the only other
        option. There are other paths, keep looking.</p>
    <p>By this point I have not eaten since I munched some unimpressive airplane
        food 1800 last night, so I’m ready to eat anything. In my excitement of
        hitting the streets this morning, stopping for food seemed a low priority. I
        snoop Yelp, which is now functional for the first time this trip, and find
        something close with more positive reviews in Italian than in English andstart walking. Upon arrival, I am seated at a large bench table with two
        other parties. The menu is hand written on a piece of paper taped to the
        wall, and I’m not sure what is what. I order a bottle of water and point at
        what my neighbor is eating, which looks good. My water and a chunk of
        bread is brought to me, and shortly thereafter my meal. In the States I
        would just call this ravioli, but I don’t see that anywhere on the menu. No
        sauce per se, but a spoonful of ground beef with its own sauce is on top with
        a powdering of hard cheese. I’m a bit taken aback by the Italian reality of al
        dente, not typical in America, but the food is delicious. I take my time,
        savoring the sauce, wiping it up with the bread. I could eat more but am not
        really hungry, and when the waitress asks if I want to order a main course
        (this apparently was a starter), I decline and pay my bill and move on.</p>
    <p>I take the rest of the afternoon for practicalities. I stop in a farmacia to buy
        shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste. I head back to the hostel and stop at the
        gelato place across the street. Not impressed. I head upstairs and chill for a
        bit before heading out to a coin laundry place. One of the things I won’t be
        taking for granted soon is the washing machine. I don’t like ever leaving
        any of my only three sets of clothes alone, so I hang out.</p>
    <p>By the time my clothes are folded and packed back up, I’m ready for dinner
        and I try a place near by. A little more touristy, but worth a try. I look over
        the menu and see categories that seem like starters vs main dishes. Most of
        the tempting stuff seems to be in the starter category, but I feel like I should
        branch out. I order the wine sautéed chicken breast with veggies and a
        water. It’s passable. Feels a bit heavy. I pay my bill and am on my way.
        Won’t be stopping there again.</p>
    <p>I start wandering and end up at il Duomo again, which looks quite different
        and very beautiful by the light of the setting sun. I continue as the lights
        dim and end up at Palazzo Vecchio. A fantastic fountain with a great big
        Neptune (deity not planet) at its center holds part of the plaza, but even
        more striking is a perfect replica of Michelangelo’s David, standing, as I
        understand it, where it was initially intended, at the door of the old Firenze
        town hall. There are many great sculptures here, and just a few yards away,
        the door to one of the greatest art museums in all the world, the Uffizi
        Gallery. The sky darkens, I soak it all in, listening to street musicians and
        trying my luck again with the gelato (much better). All in all, a good night.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
