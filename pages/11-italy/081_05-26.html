    <h1>Day 81: The Majesty Of Florence</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 26 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Florence, Italy</h3>   
  
    <p>I’m awake, out the door, and sipping my morning cappuccino by 0900.
        When finished, I swing by that mask shop I mentioned but find it still
        closed. So I move on to my first sight of the day: the Galileo Science
        Museum, covering science through medieval up through the 19th century.
        Considering just how much such a museum could encompass this is rather
        small, but I have no complaints. They had many lovely things, including a
        huge Pre-Copernican model of the heavenly spheres, the original telescopes
        made by Galileo himself, and machines from the sixteenth and seventeenth
        centuries for making electricity or air vacuums to entertain the rich at
        parties. Morbidly enough, they also had reliquaries of Galileo’s fingers
        Galileo was never made a saint my the Catholic Church to my knowledge,
        far from it, but there they are, the master’s bones, preserved in gilded glass.
        Weird.</p>
    <p>By now it’s nearly noon, so I stop for a bite. I find a place with a salad-pizza-
        drink bargain, and all the customers are speaking Italian, so I give it a go.
        The food is meh. Honestly, I’m hard pressed to accept that any country can
        currently outshine the USA on pizza, but I’ve at least tried it. If I seesomething good perhaps I’ll try again. The guy at the next table is eating
        penne, which looks much better, but if I hadn’t tried the pizza I’d regret it.</p>
    <p>Well, no time like the present to move on the the main course of the day:
        the Uffizi Gallery. Literally meaning “the office,” the Uffizi is located next to
        the Palazzo Vecchio, which is where the powerful Medici family lived, and
        from which they ruled. Eventually, they moved across the river, to
        something grander (Pitti Palace), and had a walkway suspended over the
        common folk and over the bridge connecting the palace to the office to the
        Vecchio, which still serves as the city hall today.</p>
    <p>The Uffizi Gallery houses some fabulous works. Botticelli’s The Birth of
        Venus is a definite stand out, along side Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Rubens,
        El Greko, Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and so many others. I try to place a limit
        of two hours when in a museum or gallery, but today that is a fail, and my
        head is swimming. While nearly out the door, I see they have some of the
        Da Vinci drawings here, which I did not see, and my breath catches. I spend
        the next half an hour searching the maps and galleries, asking every staff
        member I can find before finally, on my own, I discover that that gallery has
        been closed for renovation. Heart breaking, but what can you do?</p>
    <p>I take a moment to catch my breath, and at around 1530 I am entering the
        Palazzo Vecchio Museum. Typically, I am less interested in the lifestyles of
        the rich and powerful, but this is the Medici family we are talking about,
        great patrons of the arts, with fantastic taste, and divinely talented friends.
        There is a huge public hall for entertaining that screams power and cool,
        and in the living quarters, nearly every inch of wall and ceiling bears some
        art. I confess I find it all quite impressive, quite beautiful.</p>
    <p>Well, that’s Florence just about done. I leave in the early morning. I could
        stay here forever and keep finding beauty, but for what I came for, I feel
        satisfied. I swing by that mask shop one last time and find it open. The
        works inside are truly gorgeous, and far far out of my price range. I see they
        offer a class on mask making, which would have been a blast, no doubt, but
        that train has left the station.</p>
    <p>I relax for a bit, then by 1930 it’s time for dinner and I find a spot close to il
        Duomo and order the penne I was coveting earlier. There’s a couple next to
        me from America, and it takes no time at all for me to want to strangle
        them. Constantly bitching and moaning. Oh the coffee here is terrible, theydon’t have this or that. Blah blah blah. Ugh. Self absorbed, self important,
        insulated. America is many amazing things, but somehow, especially over
        the past fifty years it seems, America has become the matrix. Unfortunate.
        Comfort and safety are nice, but they aren’t everything.</p>
    <p>I tune them out as I eat my dinner, somewhere close by a busker is playing
        an accordion. I have no reason to complain. None at all. I think this is all
        wonderful.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
