    <h1>Day 80: Not Yet Around The World In…</h1>
    <h2>Friday 25 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Florence, Italy</h3>   
  
    <p>I had a wonderful, eloquent and thoughtful blog entry all typed up. Took
        hours. Seriously. Then my #%&@$!! iPhone ate it. I am feeling a little
        pissed off right now. I’ll blog it again later.</p>
    <p>So today is day eighty, a sort of benchmark in global travel, thank you Jules
        Verne. The reality is that one can now travel the globe in a single day, it’s
        really a matter of how much you want to see and how much you have to
        spend. I have about twenty-five days left, give or take.</p>
    <p>My love for Florence is deep and wonderful. It doesn’t have the spiritual
        magnitude of Jerusalem, how could it? But this still remains a place of
        profound beauty and grace, one of the great centers of art history: the birth
        of the Renaissance. Would I live here if I could? Of course I would. When
        locals see my very Italian last name, I tend to get a scolding look: why don’t
        you speak the language of your fathers? Sorry, I’m working of that.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I wake up and am on the road by 0825. I try to learn from
        yesterday’s hunger and stop for a small breakfast, Italian style: cappuccino
        and a croissant. By 0900 I am once again on the move and standing at the
        door of the Santa Maria Novella, a lovely church, but one that won’t be
        opening until 1100, alas. Well, onwards I press. As I’m in the neighborhood
        and it needs doing, I stop by the train station. It’s a bit hectic, and I’m not
        sure where I should go. Not China or India hectic, but still. I find a
        computer that sells tickets via touch screen and I’m good. A few other
        tourists seem far less sure of what to do, and there’s a young woman
        helping them for tips. The woman is by her hair and dress rather apart from
        the locals I have seen, more conservative, a little darker. I find myself
        wondering, could this be a gypsy? I know they still have quite a presence in
        Europe, but I wouldn’t know a gypsy if she wore a red bandana on her head,
        gold hoop earrings and tried to tell me my fortune. I shrug, ticket in hand,
        and move on.</p>
    <p>I walk a few blocks to the Basilica of San Lorenzo, specifically to the Medici
        Chapel. This so called chapel is vast and beautiful, and is a testament, in mymind anyway, to the uncomfortable relationship between power and art.
        These people were profoundly rich and powerful, and through their
        patronage, artists flourished. As a flower leans to the light of the sun, how
        can an artist not but lean to the money? Many of the tombs here are graced
        my masters, including Michelangelo himself. Truly beautiful.</p>
    <p>Downstairs they have a small museum, housing some of the Medici
        treasures. Among these are many reliquaries. To those new to this, a
        reliquary is a container, typically of glass to show its contents, but grandly
        ornamented in silver and gold. The reliquary would hold the mortal
        remains of a Christian saint. People would trek far and wide, hundreds of
        miles in some cases, to see these. Personally, I find it a little tweaked to
        keep and display dead body parts of saints for religious reasons. Seems to
        go against the whole point of Christianity, but what do I know. We display
        mummies often enough, I suppose, but not too many people pray to them.
        Anyway, reliquaries were one of Martin Luther’s sticking points when
        Protestantism rolled around. But here they are by the dozen: skull, femur,
        rib. Morbid much?</p>
    <p>I move on, and by 1010 I am entering the Basilica’s main church, which is
        quite lovely, but no photos. The walls have beautiful paintings and frescoes,
        and I take my time walking about. I light a candle. From here I go to the
        Basilica Library, which is quite lovely. Up a grand staircase, you enter a
        reading room, with rows and rows of benches, all with near vertical reading
        desks. Alas, no books, but still lovely. Beyond this room there is an
        exhibition on medieval surgery as shown through books and a few tools. It’s
        nice, but limited. I would love to see and learn more on this subject.</p>
    <p>By around 1115 I am stopping for lunch. It’s right off of the Medici Chapel,
        tourist central, but I try my luck. I order the lasagna, which is quite good,
        but not surprisingly a bit heavy. With a solid lunch in my belly, I head back
        to my attempted first stop, the Santa Maria Novella, which I find open and
        ready. The building itself is a lovely, modest structure of stone, but the
        facade to the front is all marble, and is larger than the building. It gives the
        strange impression of a cardboard cutout having been pasted on. It feels
        quite unnecessary, it’s a lovely building all on its own. Inside, again no
        pictures, are again some striking paintings and frescoes, including some
        works of historical note.</p>
    <p>I exit and stretch a bit, then start walking again, this time back to il Duomo,
        the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore. I really haven’t been able to savor
        the interior the way I’d have liked, and this is as good a time as any. The
        line takes no more than fifteen minutes and I’m in. I immediately, ignoring
        all sights, walk away from the side door tourists are ushered through and
        move to the central front door. I stand with my back to the door, my feet at
        the midline of the cathedral. This is the view envisioned by the architect. All
        lines lead you straight in, right to the altar, great columns towering above.
        It’s quite a sight. The interior, as noted before, is surprisingly simple and
        modest, all the showy stuff is on the exterior. You can hear the distant
        sound of someone tuning a church organ. I descend into the crypt, which is
        a bit of a museum now. It’s bits of mosaic flooring roped off, it’s great stone
        slabs preserved. As I climb back up to the main floor, someone starts
        playing the church organ in earnest and with volume, bouncing off these
        high walls. I can’t help thinking of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and
        the organ music there, hands down the winner, though this is lovely.</p>
    <p>From here I walk, not too fast, to the Bargello National Museum. It’s in an
        old building, with wonderful character. Much of the material here on
        display, confess, was less interesting. Tableware. Coins. But also in here are
        some truly important works, of particular note are some of the works of
        Donatello, a David. It makes for a fantastic comparison with
        Michelangelo’s, because it is so different. It should be noted from the start
        that while M made his David a strong, fit adult, D’s David is a youth,
        perhaps thirteen or fourteen. He is fit, but still with the soft androgyny of
        early puberty. His foot rested on the decapitated head of his defeated
        enemy, sword in hand. It is the triumph, the deed done. It is thought to be
        the first nude of the Renaissance, hardening back to the Classical era, but
        rather than displaying proud power, there is a humility in this victory. It’s
        quite a piece.</p>
    <p>From here I walk to the Ponte Vecchio, a lovely bridge spanning the Arno
        River. Not a huge river as these things go, but lovely. The bridge is famously
        lined with jewelry shops, and once (maybe still?) there was a footbridge,
        over the roofs, above us commoners, connecting the Palazzo Vecchio and
        the Pitti Palace, the city hall (and one time luxurious home to the Medici
        family) and the newer luxury palace of the Medicis, when their Vecchio
        home was no longer enough. It’s a pleasant walk, and I stop for dinner,
        some place relaxed looking. I order more ravioli, and for dessert I am very
        bad and have a cannoli, a delicious cream filled piece of magic. I shouldnever eat one of those again, but make a mental note to try and eat one
        more before leaving town.</p>
    <p>I return to my hostel and chill for a few hours, charging things up, writing,
        then stroll out to enjoy the city at night. I have seen a number of beautiful
        masks for sale, for carnival (what Americans would call Mardi Gras). It’s a
        big deal over in Venice, something I’ve always wanted to see. They dress up
        in full eighteenth century masquerade ball attire, including masks like this.
        A bit cheesy, but I like them. Curious to see if there is a similar tradition in
        Florence, I check the all-knowing Internet, and find this:
        www.alicemasks.com and I discover that it’s very close to where I am. So
        when our walking, I give it a glance. From outside, it looks pretty amazing. I
        head back in and call it a night.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
