    <h1>Day 82: Rome!</h1>
    <h2>Sunday 27 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Florence to Rome, Italy</h3>   
  
    <p>Something I don’t believe I have ever discussed. In London, Big Ben very
        nicely tolls the hour. You listen, you count, you know the time. It’s not like
        that everywhere. In Florence, and also in Jerusalem, when it’s time to ring
        the bell, they don’t hold back, they’re not shy. They ring that bell. A good,
        long, constant ring for perhaps a minute, more music than a count. Lovely,
        but don’t use it to tell the hour.</p>
    <p>Another thing: in Greece, when the women were beautiful they were
        beautiful. And when they weren’t, the results were a little disturbing. Here,
        even the plainest have a charm and grace. And when they shine, they really
        shine. Just saying.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I’m up by 0615, and I head out toward the train station. A fellow
        traveler at the hostel is unsure where the station is, so I walk her there,
        before departing to find my cappuccino; still too early to hover around the
        station.</p>
    <p>By 0915 I’m on the train and we are rolling, faster and smoother than any
        train I’ve yet been on. At 1045, right on schedule, we pull in to Roma
        Termini, and I walk the one and a half kilometers to the hostel. By 1130 my
        bag is off my shoulder and I am stopping to breathe a bit.</p>
    <p>Well rested, I’m back on my feet and I stop for a greasy lunch at the Hard
        Rock Cafe, once again, in honor of distant friends. I’m amused to see the
        painted ceiling with little cherubs holding electric guitars. From here I walk
        another kilometer or so the the famous Spanish Steps. I’m not really sure
        why they’re famous, but they are quite pretty. I suppose that’s quite a good
        enough reason in itself. From here, taking my time, I walk to the even more
        famous Trevi Fountain, reaching it at about 1420. Tremendous crowds
        surround the fountain, and small wonder: it’s absolutely beautiful.</p>
    <p>I gaze for a few minutes, then decide to head west, to the Navona District,
        which I had heard was lovely. I don’t get very far when I come across the
        facade of a large church, one of the vast army if churches in Rome, and not
        one of the small handful I know by name or sight. I decide, what the hey,
        let’s check it out, and I step inside. Wow, I mean, wow! A huge, beautiful
        church, with a breath-takingly beautiful painted ceiling. Sant’Ignazio
        Church. Just some random church I thought if check out. Glad I did. I keep
        walking toward that Navona District, when kapow! I run into another
        marvel: the Pantheon! I intended to see this at some point, but I never
        imagined just discovering it at random.</p>
    <h3>1455</h3>
    <p>The Pantheon is fantastic. Built in Classical Rome to honor all the gods, it
        was taken up by the Christians and dedicated to saints and martyrs. The
        floor inside is a perfect circle, which several chapels in the walls, which,
        drum-like, rise straight up in that circle, until they curve and form a perfect
        semicircular dome, with an oculus, a circle perhaps three meters in
        diameter, at the very top, open to air and light and sky. The floor is gently
        concaved with subtle drain holes for when it rains. Though regarding the
        rain, there is a fascinating legend of how the building is protected, and even
        when it does rain, not a drop gets in. The science of this is interesting: the
        room was lit with many candles, creating a mild curtain of heat. Rain drops
        coming from above would likely all be vaporized. And so the legend is true.
        Love it.</p>
    <p>Outside the Pantheon is another lovely fountain. There are so many
        fountains here that I dare not stop to discuss them all. Many, as in
        Florence, are just cute niches in the wall, with a running water spigot. I’ve
        been drinking consistently from such fountains, refilling my bottle as
        needed, as do many others, tourist and local alike. I think back to thetyphoid epidemic in London, spread just so, by a fountain. Well, at least
        we’ll all die together.</p>
    <p>I keep heading west. At this point I’ve forgotten about the Navona. I’ve seen
        many lovely streets, passed through charming shopping areas aplenty.
        Perhaps I’m in that district right now. More to my awareness, however, is
        how close I am to the Tiber River, and to the Castel Sant’Angelo. So that’s
        my new goal. West then north. But walking in Rome is proving to be a slow
        business: too many amazing distractions.</p>
    <p>All the same, by 1645 I reach Ponte Sant’Angelo, the bridge over the Tiber
        leading to Castel Sant’Angelo. Ah, the Tiber. The history if the human race,
        in so many ways, is a history of rivers. And few can can boast of the impact
        of this one. By no means to most magnificent, but a small village planted at
        its banks shaped a third of the world. The bridge is lovely, pedestrian, lined
        on both sides by statues. Many buskers and merchants vie for tourist
        attention and dollar. At the far end of the bridge, like a giant towering
        drum, is the Castel Sant’Angelo. Originally made as a mausoleum for
        Roman Emperors, it had been repurposed many times, and has been in
        papal service a good long while now. It has been fortified, and has withheld
        long sieges in the past. Perhaps a kilometer down the avenue lies the
        Basilica of Saint Peter, the Holy See, Vatican. Legend has it that there is a
        secret tunnel connecting the Castel Sant’Angelo to the Papal Chambers in
        the Vatican. Who can say, secret tunnels are typically secret, but I like to
        believe it, it’s the romantic in me. In any case, I am firm in my conviction
        that I shall take no further step toward the Holy See today: some things are
        too good to be rushed. That will come Tuesday, unhurried.</p>
    <p>By 1700 I am stepping through the door into the Castel Sant’Angelo. This is
        a sight rich in history, made even more interesting by a fantastic exhibit on
        art inspired by the Classical myth of Cupid and Psyche. Great story, worth
        looking up, and some lovely art on display. The tour of the castle starts low
        in what can really only be called a dungeon, spiraling up to the ramparts, to
        beautifully decorated rooms, a d finally up to the very top, offering some
        fantastic views of Rome.</p>
    <p>I’m one of the last out of the castle, around 1900, and I begin my trek back.
        Somewhere along the way I stop for a passable bowl of Fettuccine
        Bolognaise before reaching my hostel and going right to bed.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow: Pompeii!</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
