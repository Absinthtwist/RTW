    <h1>Day 86: The Borghese</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 31 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Rome, Italy</h3>   
  
    <p>Today is my last full day in Rome on this trip. There is so much more for me
        to see and do that I find it overwhelming. And I don’t mind saying I’m a
        little worn out. So I decide that as I cannot see everything, that I shall take
        my time, relax, and savor what I do see.</p>
    <p>After sleeping in I walk to the park, arriving around 1015. My time in the
        park does involve a fair amount of walking, but also a great deal of sitting
        on park benches and people-watching. I find an accordion player and sit
        across from him for a while. He plays amazingly: you haven’t lived until
        you’ve sat on a park bench in Rome and listened to a man play Toccata and
        Fugue in D Minor on an accordion. His repertoire is all classical, and only
        about six pieces which he repeats. It’s a bit annoying hearing the same stuff
        over and over, but it’s perfect for foot traffic. Soon enough it’s time to move
        on, so I throw a couple euros into the man’s bag and am on my way.</p>
    <p>I enter the Borghese Gallery early, around 1230 for a 1300 time slot. I buy a
        nice museum guide and mark the date, a habit I’ve started. You make an
        appointment for the many museums in Europe, including this one. The
        museum operates in two hour slots. Everyone enters at the same time, andin two hours the place is emptied out. So at 1300 promptly, the doors are
        opened and we all enter.</p>
    <p>The Borghese is a no photo museum, so you’ll have to take my word that it
        is gorgeous. This was the world’s first public art gallery, and is considered
        quite influential. The founder of this feast, Mr Borghese himself, was a
        powerful and ruthless Cardinal, is himself the source of the word
        “nepotism,” but he loved art. It was not uncommon for him to have people
        arrested, even threatened with execution for their “crimes” just as a way to
        get them to generously donate their art to him. Classy, but he sure had
        taste. The gallery is filled with works by the likes of Bernini (several of this
        master’s works), Rubens, Titian, and the wonderful Caravaggio, among
        others. Caravaggio is another great artist and fantastic character: the man
        died in exile, having fled Rome after killing a man in a brawl over the
        outcome of a tennis match. They took tennis rather more seriously then.</p>
    <p>The gallery is mine until 1500, but by 1430 my head is swimming and I take
        my leave. I’ve seen all the gallery anyway. I wander through the park,
        coming out at the Piazza del Popolo, which is quite lovely, and I wander the
        streets randomly until I find myself back at the Trevi Fountain, still packed
        with tourists. I continue wandering a bit more, stopping for a cannelloni
        lunch before returning to the hostel to decompress a bit.</p>
    <p>As the sun begins to decline I head out for a dinner of more carbonara and a
        glass of chianti as a jazz band sets up and starts playing. I head out and
        wander randomly until I end up back at -you guessed it – the Trevi
        Fountain, hardly a curse. The crowds are thinner with the sun down and I
        enjoy a few moments before heading south. It’s a bit of a walk, but I take
        one last look at the Colosseum, lit up for night, then make it back to my
        hostel to pack up for my departure.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
