    <h1>Day 83: Pompeii, or The Deluge!</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 24 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Rome, Italy with Pompeii road trip</h3>   
  
    <p>So I’d like to take a moment to discuss the contents of my pockets. I have a
        system which may sound crazy to some, but works for me. Somewhere in
        there I made the choice that in most cases, I’d rather look like a dork and be
        prepared. So, being thorough, let me discuss my sadly limited but
        utilitarian wardrobe. My shoes are Keens, they take a fair beating without
        trouble. I wear thick synthetic hiking socks along with super-thin sock
        liners. Gotta protect your feet, especially on the road. Concealed under the
        insole of my left shoe, well wrapped in plastic and duct tape, are color
        copies of my passport and driver license. Under the insole of my right is
        $500US. The pants are a lightweight water resistant synthetic with cargo
        pockets in front as well as side pockets for my hands. The legs zip off for a
        conversion to shorts. Like I said, utility over style. The belt is heavy nylon
        with a plastic buckle, perfect for metal detectors in airports, goes right
        through. Concealed in the cloth of the belt are copies of passport and driver
        license and $300US. The shirt is a long sleeve button down light synthetic.
        I keep a bandana in the left pocket, 1001 uses. A small carabiner holding s
        cheap compass is latched to a belt loop. A large carabiner is connected to
        the hand strap of my camera, and is latched directly to my belt, the camera
        discreetly slipping into my pocket. I keep my shirt deliberately untucked to
        help keep things concealed. As I am near-sighted and wear glasses, I carry a
        small set of clip-on shades. They have a plastic case, into which I have also
        stuffed a cloth for cleaning glasses and a small comb. This I carry in my left
        cargo pocket. In my right cargo pocket is a zip sandwich bag containing
        some simple medical suplies: band-aids, tegaderm, bacitracin, a couple
        imodium, alcohol wipes, nothing that takes up much space. Also included is
        some toilet paper, freed from its space-taking cardboard tube, rolled tight
        to a thickness just under an inch. In my left breast pocket is my iPhone. On
        my right, in a zip compartment, I keep my wallet, passport, and two spare
        batteries for my camera.</p>
    <p>I think that’s everything.</p>
    <p>So I’m awake by 0615 and out the door soon after. The sky is a little
        overcast, which, coming from Seattle, really doesn’t trouble me, but to be
        safe I check the forecast. Naples shows some light showers today, so just to
        be safe, I run back upstairs and grab my jacket. I walk to the station,
        arriving by 0800. The train departs shortly thereafter, a longer, slower ride
        than my trip to Rome. I reach Naples by 1050 and am making the
        connection to the Circumvesuviana by 1110. This all takes far longer than I
        would have liked, though I remind myself that I declined to stay in Naples
        for a couple of nights to do this right or to pay for the speed train. At 1153,
        the train drops me and a to of tourists off at the gate to Pompeii.</p>
    <p>Pompeii is huge. It was a city. Archeologists have come up with their own
        address system, including what seems like a zip code. I wish I had found the
        time to familiarize myself with a map and the priority points, but here I am
        anyway. I toy with the idea of paying the €20 for a guided tour, but instead
        go for the audioguide. I am given a map and am on my way.</p>
    <p>It takes almost no time for me to feel completely lost. My cheap-ass
        compass is acting up, displaying a 180 degree margin of uncertainty making
        it useless. The sky is a slate of gray so I’ll get no directional help from the
        sun. There are a few signs, but they really only confuse me. The map helps,
        but the rain is coming down more and more now, and I feel like I should
        protect the map. The old Roman road is a right pain in the ass to walk on,
        and there are way top many tourists here. I’m a grumpy mess. At this point,
        I realize I have not eaten since last night. So I make my way through the
        rain, feeling ever more lost and confused and grumpy, going in circles, until
        I find the small cafeteria and have a bad but helpful meal. Every seat is
        taken so I eat standing.</p>
    <p>I finish my food and eventually find a trash can to set my map on as I
        formulate a plan. I know where I am and what I’d like to see. After some
        experimenting I’ve worked out that my compass is mostly pointing east, so
        if I just treat west as north it might be serviceable. Fed and armed with a
        plan, I step outside and into a biblical flood. The rain is pouring down with
        great passion, and my ever trusty and reliable North Face jacket, which has
        never let is so much as a drop, has met its match. I am soaking completely
        through. Concerned for my phone and passport, I turn around and regroup.
        I do what I can to dry my phone and passport using toilet paper, then place
        them in the still intact ziplock bag. My camera is more than up to the task.</p>
    <p>I, however, am feeling miserable. I mentally review my sightseeing
        priorities here, knowing that if the rain holds like this I won’t last long. I
        decide there’s one more must-see (though plenty I’d regret missing) and,
        following my confused compass and the few obscure signs, I start making
        my way in the direction of the Villa of Mysteries. The rain beats down
        without relent, seeming to only come stronger, and I see I’m walking in
        circles, trying not to slip on these ancient stones. Screw it, I think. Time to
        just head for the exit.</p>
    <p>I do my very best to get to the exit, but where do I end up? The Villa of
        Mysteries, where I was trying to get in the first place.</p>
    <p>The Villa, outside the Pompeii city limits back in the day, was only found in
        the twentieth century, and is pretty well intact. I don’t know what’s original
        and what’s restoration, but this building has a roof! The reprieve from the
        rain is greatly appreciated. The Villa itself is lovely, and is particularly
        appreciated for a room of striking frescoes depicting some sort of Dionysian
        rite, which is quite striking.</p>
    <p>The chance to rest and dry and some good art and history help my mood,
        and the rain, still strong, has actually let up quite a lot. I continue exploring
        for a while, but know my time and mood are nearly done. There is still so
        much more to see, but I need to be well rested for tomorrow. That is a
        higher priority to me than today. So I sigh wistfully, hoping I can come back
        and do Pompeii more thoroughly again, knowing that leaving things
        unfinished is an essential part of life. I find the exit and catch my train back
        to Naples.</p>
    <p>By 1800 I am in Naples. I have found my train to Rome and am waiting for
        it to depart, sitting at the window as I type, cold and wet pretty much all
        over. Through the miracle of synthetics my pants and shirt are mildly damp
        but livable, and drying quickly. Through the curse of other synthetics my
        socks are waterlogged and freezing and I know it will take about seventy-
        two hours for them to dry on their own. Well, I needed to do laundry
        anyway. Tomorrow I need to be at the Vatican by 0830, so laundry will
        have to wait. I figure with any luck I’ll be in my bed by 2230. Fingers
        crossed.</p>
    <p>Not all trains are equal. This one stops at every tiny village, and my good
        humor is gone. Shame, really, as I the country we are passing through is
        quite lovely. Tiny coastal towns, rolling hills, some of the hills rising highenough for their tops to disappear in the low clouds. But my wet feet drain
        my happiness. But luck is with me. The train pulls in around 2130, I walk
        the one and a half kilometers, take a warm shower and call it a day.</p>
    <p>Safe (and dry) journey.</p>
