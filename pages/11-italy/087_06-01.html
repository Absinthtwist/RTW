    <h1>Day 87: From The Eternal City To The City Of
        Lights</h1>
    <h2>Friday 1 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Rome, Italy to Paris, France</h3>   
  
    <p>Today is a travel day, which means that as much as I adore Rome, all I want
        is to just move on. When it’s time to go, then just go. Ultimately, I think
        that spirit is something I think I should change, savor up till the last
        moment. But anyway: out the door by 0900, I take my time walking to the
        train station. By 0955, however, I am seated on an airport bound train as it
        pulls from the station.</p>
    <p>By 1030 I’m walking about the airport. The AC is on the warmest setting
        and there’s no wifi. It’s gonna be a long wait. I grab a conolo because I said I
        would, but find it far less satisfactory. There seems to be a lesson in there
        about striking when the iron is hot and not chasing yesterday’s dream but
        be present in the moment, but mostly I’m annoyed that my pastry is sub-
        par.</p>
    <p>Well, all good things, as they say, and at last I board my plane and cut
        through heavy clouds I never even noticed on the ground. I also particularly
        enjoy the sight of the Alps as we pass over their tall snow covered peaks. By
        1800, we are landing in Orly Airport just outside Paris. I take a subway
        train, and come out into lovely.</p>
    <p>What first strikes me, having just come from Rome, is how much space
        there is here, with it’s wide streets. It’s all as lovely as I could imagine. It’s
        about three kilometers to my hostel, and I choose to walk it, hugging the
        Seine as much as I can. It’s a larger river than the Arno, but smaller by far
        than the Nile or even the Thames. There seem to be a great many bridges,
        more than I am used to seeing, but I can find no fault with that. Across the
        water I see the unmistakable profile of Notre Dame Cathedral, but choose
        to keep walking.</p>
    <p>I reach my hostel at 2000. The man at the desk seems I’ll prepared and did
        not expect me, and though he speaks excellent English, in all other ways he
        perfectly embodies every American stereotype of a rude Frenchman. Well,
        it’s a sort of tourist attraction, one I could have skipped but can now crossfrom my list. Really, everyone I’ve interacted with thus far has been quite
        pleasant. They assume I speak French, but are patient when I confess that
        my vocabulary is maybe fifty words, a hundred at best. Of course, those are
        the words I know to say, once a French person starts talking at speed, I
        don’t understand a word of it. Gonna have to work on that.</p>
    <p>After settling in, I check local movies. I know Paris well enough to know
        they’ll have some great cinema happening somewhere on any given day.
        And Paris does not disappoint: Last Year in Marianbad is playing. But of
        course, being a French movie in France, I shouldn’t expect subtitles. And as
        it’s one of the more deliberately confusing surrealist films ever made, I
        decide, with the language barrier, to give it a pass. Also playing, however, is
        Ridley Scott’s new film Prometheus, which if I’m not mistaken won’t be
        hitting the states for another week. Too tempting. So I go for a walk and
        take in a show. Enjoyable and visually stunning.</p>
    <p>I make it to bed around 0100, and plan to wake around 0730. Tomorrow,
        Disneyland Paris.</p>
        <p>Safe journey!</p>
