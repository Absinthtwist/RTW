    <h1>Day 85: S.P.Q.R.</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 24 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Rome, Italy</h3>   
  
    <p>So today I sleep in. I take my time. I have breakfast. By 0900 I have all the
        various souvenirs I’ve gathered since Istanbul all gathered up and I am on
        my way. It’s a bit of an adventure, first finding a post office then being sent
        to a different post office. I buy a box and load it up, I wait forever, the nice
        man at the counter is merciful and helps me, and finally, by noon I am
        leaving the post office, considerably lighter.</p>
    <p>I’m a little frustrated by how long all that took, and walk with extra speed to
        get me to the Roman Forum, the great Colosseum towering a block away.
        These are the very stones upon which walked Julius Caesar, Cicero,
        Augustus Caesar, so many others. It’s stunning. The original senate
        building had been converted into a church long ago then into the museum
        exhibit It is now. Amazing to imagine the debates that took place here in
        this room. Also of note here in the Forum is the House of the Vestal Virgins,
        which tended the eternal flame of of hearth and home, something the
        Romans took very, very seriously. The Vestals were given great honor and
        privilege, so long as they uphelp their post and their chastity: those who
        broke that oath were buried alive.</p>
    <p>The real gem, however, is the Arch of Titus. The Romans would build a
        triumphal arch to celebrate a victory, and the victorious army would parade
        through the arch with great pomp. The arch is decorated is a way which
        marks its importance. This arch shows friezes of the victorious Roman
        army carrying a candelabra, or more accurately, a menorah. And there is
        even an image of soldiers carrying something suggestive of the Ark of the
        Covenant. Who can say, really? This arch marks the fall of Jerusalem,where the great Temple, Holiest of Holies, was destroyed completely.
        Message clear: don’t screw with Rome.</p>
    <p>I move on the the great Colosseum. The name “Colosseum” is in fact a
        nickname, coming from the colossal statue of Nero which once stood at the
        door. It’s pretty fabulous to see, but I can’t quite get out of my head the idea
        that this was a place of public execution, without even a hint of solemnity or
        respect. They cheered and laughed and yelled for more. Time has been
        pretty harsh to the Colosseum, half the outer wall gone, staircases turned to
        rubble. Nary a glimpse of remaining marble anywhere. Still, through all
        that, even if only by sheer size alone, this remains very impressive.</p>
    <p>Well, by 1545, knowing I could keep finding amazing things forever, I move
        on. I am all too aware of tomorrow being my lady full day in Rome for this
        trip. The image of Gregory Peck in the final shot of Roman Holiday comes
        to mind, the mixture of pride and sadness watching him walk out the long
        hall Goodbye, thank you for the amazing memories.</p>
    <p>Well, no need to nail the coffin shut just yet. I walk north, once again
        passing the wonderful Trevi Fountain before coming to something of an
        oddity: Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini, or more to the point,
        it’s crypt. Here, for the last several centuries, the monks of the Capuchin
        Brotherhood have made art in this crypt using the bones of deceased
        monks. It’s really about as bizarre and morbid as it sounds, the walls lined
        with skulls. Designs of the walls shaped with ribs. Cute stars from
        sternums. Yeah. No photos allowed, but have a peek. I’m pretty creative,
        but not even I could make this up.</p>
    <p>And finally, and best of all, I stop at a small, unremarkable looking church a
        block from my hostel. Unremarkable from the outside. The inside, however,
        is quite a different matter. The art within is extraordinary and over the top,
        beautiful. But the real magic us the side chapel. A figure of a rather
        peaceful, mildly smiling angel with and arrow held in his hand as if ready to
        throw. And opposite him, a young woman in the throws of profound
        emotional experience, exceeding her, more than she thought possible her
        body, her face, seem ready to rupture. Perfect awe. The Ecstasy Of Saint
        Teresa, by Giovanni Bernini. The rapture on her face is profound to look
        upon. Transformative, and more than a little sexual. If a bomb were about
        to go off, I think I would throw myself in front of this statue. Not merely
        this statue, but the beauty it holds, what it conveys, this is it for me. This ismy answer to life. And it is a spiritual experience to share a room with such
        frank and profound emotion captured forever in marble.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I walk the one block back to my room and take a nap. Not sure
        when I last had a nap, but it sure doesn’t feel recent. When I wake, it’s
        around 1930 or so. I relax and write for a bit, then head out for a dinner of
        spaghetti carbonara, which I enjoyed.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow I have a reservation for the Borghese Gallery at noonish
        (actually 1300, but you must be there thirty minutes prior and earlier is
        better in my book). Other than that, I’m not sure what tomorrow will bring.
        But then, who is?</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
