    <h1>Day 95: To Cracow</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 9 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Paris, France to Cracow, Poland</h3>  
    <p>I’m not entirely sure how long it will take to get to the airport, or really even
        how to get there, so I am up early and out the door by 0700 just to be safe.
        Turns out there’s a train going right to the airport, no problem, and I am
        there by 0800. Paris is well organized and I figured it would be like this, but
        I hate the thought f missing a plane, and I tend to be over-cautious. I sit and
        read for a while, an enjoyable rest, and by 0935 I am in line to check in.
        More waiting, and more waiting still, and finally, by 1115 we are finally
        boarding. This flight is through easyJet, one of the cheap airlines, and they
        give no seat assignments. Whatever, just get me there.</p>
    <p>Wheels down in Cracow at 1330. No immigration inspection, presumably as
        I’m coming from inside Europe, so I just walk right out and find a bus into
        town. It gets me kinda close, and I walk the remainder. I’m walking in to
        the old city center, still feeling quite medieval, and is damn charming. I find
        my hostel and drop off my bag at 1530, then go walk around the old city.
        There’s a wide square filled with people. Musicians ply their trade, locals
        dressed up posing for pictures. A fantastic old church. Even a Hard Rock
        Cafe. I am reminded that not so long ago this was all on the wrong side of
        the Iron Curtain. Nothing says the fall of an oppressive communist regime
        like a Hard Rock Cafe.</p>
    <p>Down the road and up a hill I find a castle which I explore a bit, and
        another beautiful church. Within are monument tombs to sixteenth century 
        rulers I have never heard of, and I am again struck by how little I know of
        Poland, and how everything here is a delightful mystery.</p> 
    <p>By 1800 I stop and have a rest at a cafe in the old town square. I keep my
        meal simple, Paris was a budget catastrophe but one I accepted. Mostly I
        am here for the free wifi. I update my phone and upload a few more pics to
        my website, then pretty much call it a night. A little extra sleep sounds
        fantastic, and I should wake early tomorrow anyway, I’m expecting
        complications with the tour I arranged from the states. Poor
        communication.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
