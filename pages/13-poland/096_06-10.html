    <h1>Day 96: The Darkest Stain</h1>
    <h2>Sunday 10 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Cracow, Poland, with road trip to Auschwitz</h3>  
    <p>I went to bed early, all the same, I’m surprised to find myself awake before
        six. I’ve been in the same time zone a good couple of weeks, not that. Either
        way, I grab a shower then lie about a bit longer. At 0700 is the sound of
        someone sounding a bugle. Something somber and official sounding. This
        is done on the hour, apparently. Suddenly my early rise is a little less
        mysterious.</p>
    <p>By 0720 I’m on the street, and by 0815, a good Fourty-five minutes early, I
        am waiting. Eventually I do find someone helpful, and I am on the bus and
        on the road by 0910. Not one bit of complication, excellent.</p>
    <p>It’s a bit of a drive from Krakow, and we disembark at 1010. What I think of
        as Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp, is actually a cluster of several camps.
        The Nazis built these (read: forced others to build) camps near the Polish
        village of Oswiecim (pronounced in Polish Osh-witch- em) which the Nazis
        Germanized into Auschwitz. We start at Auschwitz 1, the first camp.
        Originally used for soviet POWs and political trouble makers, it gradually
        transformed into the “final solution.” As we pass under the wrought iron
        sign reading “Arbeit Macht Frei,” I feel a terrible chill and a shudder. No
        one should ever have to see this place. EVERYONE should have to see this
        place.</p> 
    <p>Even more disturbing, after going through camp 1, we move on to camp 2:
        Berkinau. As close to Hell as this world has ever come. The great gas
        chambers and ovens now lay destroyed. I feel a bit conflicted about this: the
        historian in me wants them whole forever, for all to see. The human being
        in me feels nothing but grim satisfaction on seeing the rubble. As if in
        punctuation, a rain begins to fall as we walk away.</p>
    <p>Another hour on the bus and I am back in the Town Square by 1530, and I
        make for the Hard Rock Cafe. I should be a good traveler and go look for
        some local specialties, but a little mindless distraction sounds just perfect
        right now, so nachos it is. I take it pretty easy for the rest of the day. My
        hostel roommates are a pair of guys from Portugal, loads of friendly fun,
        here to see the EuroGames – football, and there is plenty of excitement in
        town over it, believe me – over in the Ukraine (which apparently doesn’t
        have nearly as good travel infrastructure as Krakow). The Ukraine looks
        pretty far on the map to me, but I suppose closer than Portugal. I spend the
        evening relaxing and working on my website, which should finally be
        current after a lapse in Paris. Tomorrow: Edinburgh.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
