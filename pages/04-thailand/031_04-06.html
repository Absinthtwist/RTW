    <h1>Day 31: Bangkok, The City Of Angels</h1>
    <h2>Friday 6 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Bangkok, Thailand</h3>
        <p> More than any city I have yet been to, Bangkok is, to me at least, a city of
            smells, and most all of them good. The streets are dotted with what appear
            to my untrained eyes to be gardenia trees, and every park and temple
            sprouts lotuses. As you walk through markets you are treated to such a
            blissful exotic perfume as I can imagine, curry and fresh chilies, cinnamon,
            pineapple, fruits I know only from legend, and things else I know not what
            they are. It’s quite beautiful, quite different.</p>
        <p> My feet are a little mad at me, and I have a good book, so after sleeping in, I
            lounge in bed till nearly 1100, then begin my day with a visit to the National
            Museum. Not bad, but not amazing, and not air conditioned. Rough.</p>
        <p> I take a boat across the river to a temple, quite busy and festive with people
            – locals mostly – everywhere. There are steps from the temple down
            into the river, loaded to bursting with pigeons. And the water around the
            steps and the jetty is boiling, just completely jam-packed, with the most
            excited fish I have ever seen. I think I could step off the boat and walk to the
            temple without the jetty just by walking on the countless fish. My fish siting
            yesterday was nothing to this. When I see vendors selling bread for the
            birds and fish, it all clicks.</p>
        <p>I walk through the temple and to the street, heading south to my goal.
            Maybe a kilometer away I find it: Wat Arun. </p>
        <p> It was extremely visible from the other side of the river, the truly giant
            stupa towering into the air, decorated with a beautiful mixture of statuary
            and mosaics. It’s a steep climb up, as high as one can go but by no means
            the top.</p>
        <p> The steps are more ladder than staircase, but I’ve come this far, and really,
            steep staircases, I’ve sung that song a couple times now. After taking in the
            view and soaking up the vibe, I descend and move on.</p>
        <p> I pick up a rather attractive bit of cloth, silk and pashmina, a scarf or
            perhaps a table runner, for 200 baht. That’s about US$6.50. I suppose I
            could have haggled down, but whatever. That’s a game I’ll learn as I go. I
            also pick up a very beautiful mask, and again I probably paid way too much,
            1300 baht, but again, whatever. Here’s to hoping I can ship them back
            without a headache.</p>
        <p>            I wander through the wonderful markets as the dusk comes. All manner of
            food, souvenir trinkets, amulets (these appear to be quite popular with the
            locals, many many stalls), and beverages of course. I see some interesting
            activity across the street and make my way to the Royal Field, flush with
            people, almost all of them locals. There are perhaps a dozen kites flying in
            the air. Three stages of music are set up along the grass and I head in for abetter look. Come official sunset there is a ding on the PA system and
            suddenly everyone freezes where they are. If they were seated, they get to
            their feet a d stand still. I have just enough time to think that this is a little
            creepy, like something out of a 1960′s Star Trek episode, then they all start
            singing what I can only assume would be the national anthem. I remain still
            and respectful until the song ends, then go find a good seat on the grass by
            one of the three stages. </p>
        <p> Each if the three stages has young adults or teens, one stage with
            instruments playing cheesy band music of some sort. Another appears to be
            a traditional play that I can in no way follow, and the third stage has
            traditional music and dance of some kind. Not the stuff they roll out for the
            tourists, but interesting. This, in my mind, is a real gem. You can’t plan this
            sort of thing. I stay well after dark, enjoying the breeze and the various
            entertainments.</p>
        <h3> 2015</h3>
        <p>Back on the Khao San, having a bite to eat. I remember being in Hong
            Kong, I kept reaching for something to compare what I was experiencing.
            But the very simple truth is that Hong Kong is not like New York or Las
            Vegas. Hong Kong is absolutely Hong Kong. So too I find here in Bangkok,
            though I think, for the moment, I have learned my lesson. Bangkok is like
            Bangkok. It sets it’s own standard. Particularly here, on Khao San. Alive,
            pulsing. Full of life. Chaos. The people watching here is top drawer
            material. I have observed the road at 0800, at noon, and of course at night.
            The results are predictable and obvious. Much of this place is open 24/7,
            but clearly it is the night that brings it alive. </p>
        <p>Well, that’s about it for today. Back again for more tomorrow.</p>
        <p> Safe journey.</p>
