    <h1>Day 34: Easy Day and Flight to Kolkata</h1>
    <h2>Monday 9 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Bangkok, Thailand to Kolkata, India</h3>

    <h3>1045</h3>
        <p> Back to Siam mall. These travel days are hard for me. I don’t want to
            do anything too heavy or time consuming, don’t want to take even a minor
            risk of missing a flight. Also, I just want to go go. I love Thailand, but now
            it’s time for India. So I will chill. I picked up a device which I believe will let
            me charge my iPhone using AA batteries. If it works, it might be a game
            changer. I’m trying to decide on seeing another movie or seeing the
            aquarium here. As a rule, aquariums can only hold my interest a couple
            hours, and it’s about five times more expensive. They also have a Madame
            Tussaud’s, but that is a bridge too far.</p>
        <p> I went ahead and watched Titanic. The 3D was a total waste. All it seemed
            to do was make the screen dark. I’ve heard this before, but this is the first
            time I’ve really gotten the before-after with a film I have seen many times
            and know well. More than once I caught myself trying to take off my
            sunglasses only to realize they were the 3D glasses.</p>
            <h3>1920</h3>
        <p> Airport. Boarding now.
            Security screenings very serious here. Two screenings. And they stopped
            two things all the other airports let by: my tiny collapsible sewing scissors
            and a
            length of cord I kept for drying clothes or just the unexpected. Certainly
            don’t want me garroting anyone. Anyway, it helps lighten the bag. The first
            screening is the normal one, the second, at the gate before you board,
            included a hand search of every bag and a metal detecting wand. I try not to
            be annoyed by it. Thailand and India have both had problems with
            terrorism, far be it from me to bitch.</p>
        <p> Watched film The Debt on the flight. Pretty good. I respect the ending, but
            it still felt a little flat.</p>
        <p>A first: the immigration gave me what felt was a warm and genuine
            welcome to his country. Wonderful start. </p>
        <p> And again with the bag screening as you enter the airport. Kolkata airport is
            not impressive, just saying. Bangkok was big and modern and shiny. This
            one is very tiny and looks old and neglected. Less an international airport
            and more a barnstop. Siem Reap Airport was more impressive. No cash
            machine in sight, so I cash in some of my backup money. I budgeted around
            $1300 for my sixteen days in India, knowing it was a very conservative
            figure. When I exchange $800, the 38,000 rupees he gives me is such a
            huge stack that I am suddenly a little nervous. I look like a drug dealer with
            this stack. Or a very easy mark. So either I’m going to be doing very well
            indeed with my budget, or every transaction will take a zillion bills. I’m
            thinking the former.</p>
        <h3>2240</h3>
        <p> Indian taxi. I want to laugh but repress it. All the stories, every cliche
            is true. Crazy traffic. Honk for everything. Coming up behind a car? Honk a
            bunch. Changing lanes (did I say lanes? I meant vague lane-ish regions of
            the road)? Honk. Cracks me up. The cab itself looks like it could fall apart
            any second, and looks nearly as old as me. All the cabs are pretty much the
            same. Want air conditioning? Roll down a window. On the cab dash are tiny
            plastic altars with tiny pink and green lights.</p>
        <p> On the drive in, I saw many areas on the pavement laid out with blankets
            and people sleeping on them. Many many. Standard American
            homelessness seeks to be subtle. Not these. It just seems normal, accepted.
            They don’t look destitute, just… sleeping outside. And why not, it’s a
            pleasant night.</p>
        <p> By 2330 I arrive at the Fairlawn Hotel. It feels like something out of a
            Merchant-Ivory film. It has age to it. I read that this hotel has been family
            owned since the 1930s, but the place seems older than that. And intensely
            British. I step into this place and suddenly feel the urge for a gin and tonic.
            I am led up to my room, an entire room all to myself, complete with AC,
            ceiling fan, and my own bathroom with an old style bathtub (alas no claw
            feet on the tub, that would have been too perfect).</p>
        <p> Tomorrow I go explore Kolkata. Not entirely sure what my plan is. Find the
            station for tomorrow’s train. Really, that’s about it.</p>
        <p> Safe journey.</p>
