    <h1>Day 33: Ayutthaya</h1>
    <h2>Sunday 5 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Bangkok, Thailand</h3>
        <p>Happy Easter. </p>
        <h3>0730</h3>
        <p> Sitting on a large, reasonably comfortable tour bus, waiting for it to fill
            before departing. Not the cliche double decker thing, more like a distance
            travel bus. Given the ninety minute ride, not a bad call. The 0545 wake up
            was no fun, but I feel this is worth it. Tomorrow 2000 I fly out, so really, by
            1700 tomorrow Thailand is done.I know I’m a little behind posting pics, sorry about that, I’ll catch up soon.
            Tonight I hope.</p>
        <h3>0850 Summer Palace</h3>
        <p> Our first stop is to the Royal Summer Palace. It’s very pretty, made in the
            latter half of the nineteenth century. But it’s very very European. I could be
            in France right now. Not what I’m looking for today, but I try to take it for what it’s worth. The tour guide is quite
            pleasant. He does what he can to keep things humorous and informative,
            but the crowd I’m with is pretty much the crowd I try to avoid. It is what it
            is.</p>
        <p> From there it gets more interesting with some pleasant ruins (I try not to
            grade in the Angkor Wat scale but I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t in my
            thoughts) then on to a lovely temple. So far these are
            more or less the type of thing many tourists are clueless about but that I
            find on my own. I remind myself it includes an air conditioned bus, a meal,
            an entertaining tour guide and is only costing me US$35.</p>
        <p>Just found out that my cooking class was filled up. For the best really. Sleep
            in. Lounge around. Soak up the local color. Cooking class another day. In
            New Delhi perhaps. </p>
        <p> Another stop, at a giant reclining Buddha. Just a hair smaller than the
            famous one in Bangkok, and outdoors. Also stone rather than golden. I
            figure, with all this temple hopping I should
            pay my respects, so for 20 baht I pick up the standard set: candle, lotus
            bud, and incense. A local helps me through the procedure. Light the candle
            at a small altar, use the candle to light the incense and stick it in a pot, place
            the lotus on a table. The set also includes about a one inch square of gold
            leaf. At the altar sits a Buddha statue of stone, with bits of gold leaf here
            and there. My assistant rubs a spot with a candle, and I apply my gold leaf.
            In thanks I let my assistant talk me into buying three amulets of luck. Then
            another young woman comes and I buy a cord to hang an amulet from my
            neck, and what the hell, she throws in another amulet.</p>
        <p> Feeling very lucky indeed (and a wee bit poorer), I return to my bus for the
            next leg of my mystery tour.</p>
            <h3>1315</h3>
        <p>Looks like we are leaving our bus for good. We are led to an air
            conditioned boat and a buffet and start moving down the river. The food is
            reasonable and the boat is comfortable. I’m seated with a pleasant family
            from New Zealand. They tell me two weeks is a good minimum to see their
            country, three is better. Very high on my list. </p>
        <p> Sitting in my comfy air conditioned boat, belly full of adequate food, all I
            can think is that this is a lesson, and I am grateful to learn it. A little
            comfort is a good thing, but it is not my priority. I would have done better
            to hop a bus up to Ayutthaya and explore on my own. The reality is that I
            did not know that, so no use making a case of it. Just… lesson learned. I
            have s few more tours, hand picked. I’ll stick with them, but will think twice
            before swimming too deep into tourist waters. I’m deep enough as it is.</p>
        <h3>1530</h3>
            <p> Off the boat and waiting while the coordinate transport back to our
                respective hotels. I could really have given this tour a pass, but done is
                done, no real harm. Ready for a nap though</p>
        <h3>2100</h3>
        <p> Back at hostel. Wonderful wrath of God monsoon thunderstorm raging
            outside. Taking it easy tonight and will get as much sleep as I can. I still
            have much of the day in Bangkok, but tomorrow evening I fly to Kolkata.</p>
        <p> Will probably turn in early tonight. Not much of a party animal. Many of
            the kids coming here, that’s all they see. I just Never really understood
            parties. Never met anyone anywhere ever who was made more sexy by
            being drunk
            and/or high. And I would rather remove my eyes with a corkscrew than
            suffer through empty pointless small talk. I’m just not that guy. I suppose
            that’s where Bangkok and I just agree to disagree. I love the vibrancy and
            the culture, they like the beaches and cheap booze. Oh well. I am what I am.</p>
        <p> Safe journey!</p>
