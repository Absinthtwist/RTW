    <h1>Day 32: Khmer Sorcery</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 7 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Bangkok, Thailand</h3>
        <h3>0955 Sitting down for breakfast.</h3>
        <p> Planning a long trip today. Something special. Something magical.</p>
        <h3>1018</h3>
        <p> In the cab. Think I was able to communicate well enough with driver.
            Agrees to 350 baht for the drive. That seems way low, but ok by me.
            We had to stop and root through the google map a little but we are off the
            track on this one. Price went up to 600 and really that seems more fair. I
            was gonna give a big tip anyway</p>
        <p> End up giving driver 1000 baht and he will wait for me. We arrive at 1115</p>
        <h3>Wat Bang Phra </h3>
        <p>By 1130 I am in the correct room offering made 100baht a lotus flower a
            pack of cigarettes and a candle and a packet incense sticks. I am seated with
            nine others, all Thai. I am “told” things start at noon-ish. </p>
        <p> The Metaphor Shot.</p>
        <p> I read somewhere the monk reads your aura and decides the best tattoo for
            you. There certainly don’t seem to be any images to select from. But if I
            wanted that I could have gotten that on Khao San very easily. This is
            something different.</p>
        <p> I was sold two copies of a DVD about the monks here for 200 baht. He
            blessed me and the DVDs. He also drew a blessing symbol on the DVD
            cases and threw in am amulet. Said wealth and happiness were assured.
            And said I would find a girlfriend in three days. Not bad for 200 baht. I
            then went back into the room to wait my turn.</p>
        <p> Perhaps fifteen people or more by this time. Not to blow the reverence of
            the moment but it went through my head that only in Thailand can you find
            a monk smoking a cigarette while doing a tattoo. It’s a classic image, but I
            felt the camera was an obvious no-no. A second monk came in and half the
            crowd, including me, went over. The monk sits, and with a needle two,
            maybe two and a half feet long, tap-tap-tap-poke-poke-pokes the design
            into the back. The skin is pulled tight to either side by others waiting. There
            was one woman in the group, the monk did her tattoo in oil rather than ink.
            So the tattoo remains invisible but the blessing has full effect. My turn. It’s
            been around fifteen years since my last tattoo, and those were done with the
            standard tattoo pen. This, the old traditional way, is a little more intense.
            Ouch. But it sure made being present for the experience rather easy. This is
            absolutely one to remember, and the ultimate in souvenirs.</p>
        <h3> 1245</h3>
        <p> done. Back in the cab.
            it’s a bit of a drive again, then I return back to the hostel, gather up my
            acquisitions and walk to a post office. I’m getting the hang of this. No more expensive than I imagined. I return back to chill out of the sun for a bit,
            finish reading Catching Fire and sign up for a day trip to Ayutthaya. I was
            up there for my Elephantstay, but I was focused, obviously, on that
            experience and saw nary a temple or ruin. The pictures look too amazing to
            pass up, so tomorrow come the dawn I go. I’m still a little on
            the fence about the cooking class, if I do it, if it’s not too late to sign up,
            then that’s my day. I get back in ime to grab my bag then hit the airport.
            Maybe one last stroll. We’ll see. </p>
        <h3> 1900  Khao San</h3>
        <p> More green curry. Can’t get enough.</p>
        <p> Mango shake a good pairing. Music is hoot: bossa nova covers of Guns ‘n
            Roses songs. Definitely worth a download. Also worth noting: any table
            with more that three people in this restaurant is occupied by Thai locals.
            They do come play in Khao San, and they they do it as a big joyful group</p>
        <p>During the day, Thailand is amazing, Bangkok is amazing. But when the
            sun goes down, and the breeze comes… So many people I know have raved
            about Thailand. I have made an effort on this trip to avoid expectations and
            preconceptions, but whatever ghost of a thought I had in my head of
            Thailand, the reality has delivered and surpassed. The heat would take
            some getting used to, but I think I could spend a long time here. </p>
        <p> Interesting sidebar: I always assumed my iPhone’s GPS was carried along with the cellular signal. It would appear to the contrary. As a precaution, I brought my old, deactivated iPhone with me. It works fine, just not as cool and no cellular signal. So for larks I took it out today and made a very interesting discovery. Even without that rather expensive signal, even without any data (supposedly) going in or out, I could still pull up the GPS and track my movements. I had to use off-line maps, no google maps, but there it was. Functional and accurate. Given the crazy money I am paying to keep data coming to my phone, maybe this is something to revisit. As a slightly paranoid footnote: if a deactivated phone still knows where it is, who else does? Hmmmmm…….</p>
        <p> Dear Barnes & Noble… </p>
        <p> THIS is what a book store looks like. </p>
        <p>Fact: it costs me 60-80 baht to do a load of laundry, depending how badly I
            want my stuff really dry. Fact: a new tee shirt costs 100 baht. Do the math.
            Oddly enough I have not bought a shirt, but it would probably be cheaper.</p>
        <p>I make it back to my room and apply some bacitracin to my new ink. I
            should have brought a lot more bacitracin. Oh well. And finally, it occurred
            to me that along with being a fine computer and camera, my iPhone is also
            an iPod, and contains some of greatest music in the world I know of. I slip
            on the headphones, kill the lights, and disappear, the way that only beauty
            can let you do. Eyes moist and grateful for the entire human race, even the
            crazy stupid hurtful ones, every one of them, I call it a night.</p>
            <p>Safe journey. </p>
            <p>   And to all of you, and all the world… thank you</p>
