    <h1>Day 29: A Farewell to Elephants and a Return to Bangkok</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 4 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Ayutthaya to Bangkok, Thailand</h3>
    <p> Up early and mucking out the elephants’s pens. It’s quite a mess, and hard
        work, but quite satisfying. And I confess I also felt a bit wistful: this will be
        my last time, unless I am able to return, and who knows when that may be.</p>
    <p> By the final ride of the day, I feel like I am beginning to get a handle for
        this, and alas, it is time to give Honey one last affectionate pat then say
        goodbye. Also a bit sad is the parting of new friends. Through the magic of
        the Internet it is hoped that ties may hold over distance, but the road ever
        cries forward.</p>
    <p> It’s a long car ride back to Bangkok, shared with my new friend and fellow
        elephant handler, Leah. We chat a bit, but soon slip into quiet: it’s been a
        very full few days. We are both dropped off at Khao San Road, get ourselves
        checked in to our respective accommodations, then we sit down for a
        relaxing bite to eat. We step on to the street to have a look at the truly over-
        stimulating Khao San, but agree we are both worn out from the day and
        part company. I wander through the maze of shops and stalls perhaps
        another thirty minutes then return home for laundry and sleep.</p>
    <p> Tomorrow Bangkok!</p>
    <p> Safe journey!</p>
