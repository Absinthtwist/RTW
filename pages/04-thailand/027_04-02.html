    <h3>0745</h3>
    <p>  0745 journey already starting. My ride to the elephant stay sanctuary was
        scheduled for 0800, and at 0740 I went to the desk of my hostel to check
        out and relax a moment, maybe score some breakfast, only to discover the
        driver is ready to go. Should be 60-90 minutes.  </p>
    <p> Arrived by 0910. Big welcome get-together with staff, volunteers and the
        other ten or so guests. Safety, protocol, what have you. Soon enough we are
        each assigned an elephant of our own for the duration of our stay, my
        elephant is named “Honey.”</p>
    <p>Before much longer we are up and meeting our elephants. And right to the
        point, we kick off our shoes and up a staircase then sit, bareback, on the
        neck of the elephant, just forward of her massive shoulders. This is our first
        encounter with the amazing Thai elephant handlers, called mahouts
        (pronounced ma-hoot). To the mahout, this is not a job, this is culture, this
        is tradition, this is family. The mahout bonds with his or her elephant at
        birth, and the elephant is deeply loved. And not just by the mahouts: Thaiculture at large holds the elephant in high esteem. In the Buddhist karmic
        cycle of reincarnation, the elephant is the step before being reborn human. </p>
    <p>So I awkwardly find my position on my elephant’s large neck. My mahout is
        right behind me, helping me. Everything you may have learned from riding
        horses is completely useless here. Your bare feet dangle around your
        elephant’s ears, and her shoulders roll when she walks. You end up with
        your hands forward, bracing yourself on the top of her head while you learn
        to just roll your hips as she goes. Once you get the feel of it, your hands are
        really only for balance. We don’t go far, perhaps a five minute slow walk to
        the river, where all ten elephants walk into the water, and they don’t mind
        dunking their heads. As they roll down, it feels a bit like what I imagine a
        bucking bronco must feel like, only in slow motion. Water up to my
        armpits, and don’t forget, elephants like to spray. Another word of warning:
        elephant poo floats, that’s all I’m saying. </p>
    <p> We ride the elephants back to our staircase and one by one disembark. The
        rest of the day is spent hauling around pineapple tops and mangos to feed
        to our elephants, and scrubbing our elephants down (avid getting very wet ourselves in the process). Around
        1600 we had a second, longer ride, then led our girls out to their sleep area.</p>
    <p> After that, we all share a a few beers and indulge in extraordinary Thai
        food, made by a very lovely woman of little English. They reduce the
        spiciness for us western wussies, otherwise it is to die for.</p>
    <p> From there I return to my air- conditioned hut and I sleep like a rock.</p>    
    <p> Safe journey!</p>
