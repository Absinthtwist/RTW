    <h1>Day 30: Bangkok, The City Of Angels</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 5 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Bangkok, Thailand</h3>
    <p> Got a reasonably early start today, making my way to the river, and walking
        along a pleasant path at its side. Went past the National Museum and
        Thammasat University, and found myself at the door to the Grand Palace
        before 0900.</p>
    <p> The Palace itself, mostly off-limits, was impressive, but for me, the really
        impressive sight was the adjoining temple Wat Phra Kaew. Quite beautiful.
        Home to the Emerald Buddha, which honestly, was too small and high up
        to really appreciate.</p>
    <p>As I understand it, the Buddha is not actually emerald, the great value
        obviously placed upon it is more cultural in nature. A quick peek at
        Wikipedia shows this statue as a quasi-mythic aura about it. Still, amazing
        temple grounds. </p>
    <p>From here it’s just a short walk to Wat Pho, and one of the most iconic
        sights of Bangkok. The Reclining Buddha. </p>
    <p>Let me assure you, it lives up to its reputation. Like the Grand Canyon or
        the Great Plains of the American Midwest, some thinks just defy
        photography: they must be seen with your own eyes to really appreciate. </p>
    <p> It’s at about this point that I decide I’d like to see more Thais than
        westerners and set out for a rather obscure Temple toward the east of the
        city. Not the sticks at all, but not on the tourism beat.</p>
    <p> The journey begins with a boat down the river (Martin Sheen not invited),
        then a short walk to the metro station. Two trains later, I’ve gone as far as
        public transit will take me, stop for a quick beverage and brief airconditioned respite from the sweltering street before beginning my walk.
        With google maps as my guide, I set out east and start walking.</p>
    <p>You can’t really ever describe yourself as lost with functioning GPS, but I do
        make a few wrong turns and walk a few wonderful back roads, all in
        desperate need of a reasonably clean toilet after
        that beverage break. After a few more agonizing kilometers, I find a small
        but modern grocery store and feel much better. I buy two water bottles, one
        to drink and one to soak my handkerchief to combat the heat, and keep
        walking.</p>
    <p>I do find my temple, Wat Thong Nai, and wander around for a bit. No a
        single tourist. A few monks walk about their monk business. A few locals
        come for prayer. At the back of this temple, in the middle of the city, I am
        surprised to find a small but pleasant river. I hear a splash and see the most
        peculiar sight:
        the river is filled with fish, and they all seem to be trying to bounce off the
        water’s surface. Never jumping out, but just rippling and occasionally
        splashing the water. There is so much of this that the river looks to be in a
        slow boil. Never seen anything quite like it.</p>
    <p> Trudging through all this muggy heat, I have decided that today is the day
        to go see a movie. I had toyed with the idea as early as my first stop, Hong
        Kong, and today is the day. Soak up all that frigid AC and a tall icy soda. I
        consider grabbing a taxi for the ride back, but everyone else seem to have
        similar ideas. Bladder empty, the walk back is hot and muggy of course, but
        much easier.</p>
    <p> An air conditioned metro ride away and I am at a high end mall. Before the
        movie I take a quick detour to the bookstore where I pick up the second
        Hunger Games book, Catching Fire. A fast bite to eat and a cold cold
        beverage, and I am ready for my movie.</p>
    <p>Movie theaters here have reserved seating and three price tiers. The back
        row is poofy couches at 800 baht for two people. The front five rows are the
        cheap seats. I take the front seat of the mid range: it’s pretty much where
        I’d normally sit and I get my precious leg room. After the coming
        attractions, mostly American, the entire audience stands – and I join them
        – for what looks very clearly to be a Thai version of God Save the King. Thescreen shows images of the King and Thai people, all very well done. And
        with that, the movie starts. English with Thai subtitles. I gotta say, Thai
        writing from the corner of the eye looks very similar to English writing,
        perhaps upside down and backwards, and that mixed with years of reading
        subtitles in foreign movies, my eyes keep darting down to try to read. No
        success. </p>
    <p>One major shortcoming, in my experience with Bangkok, is how the metro
        system goes nowhere near some of the city’s biggest attractions, including
        Khao San Road where I am saying. Seeing how crazy and rowdy that street
        can be, I wonder if it’s for some reason deliberate. Regardless, I had either a
        very long walk or cab ride in front of me, and chose the latter. The driver I
        flagged down was reticent to head into ugly traffic, and I ended up paying
        nearly twice the price I paid last time for a similar distance, 150 baht. But
        it’s hard to bitch about a five buck cab ride. What would this ride have cost
        me in Manhattan? </p>
        <p> Feet aching and the sunburns on my legs – covered up all day –
            exacerbated by who knows what? Cloth friction plus sweat? No clue, but
            they sure sting. I hose myself down, crawl into bed with my book and call it
            a night.</p>
    <p> Safe journey.</p>
