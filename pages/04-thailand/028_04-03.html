    <h1>Day 28: So This Is What Heaven Looks Like…</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 3 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Ayutthaya, Thailand</h3>
    <p> Awoke before 0700 then out to rake and shovel away elephant pens and
        make them nice. I don’t mind saying it was some hard work on my soft
        hands. More riding, for longer distances. Not exactly relaxed or confident,but feeling much improved in my riding. All in all a good day, not dissimilar
        to yesterday.</p>
    <p> My fellow guests here are composed of two more yanks like myself, these
        two from Texas, an Australian couple, a mother- daughter pair from
        Canada, and two more from the UK. A good mix. The staff running the
        elephant stay run similar lines, Australian and British. The mahouts have a
        village adjoining the area where we are, the elephant kraal.</p>
    <p> The best translation to kraal I can see would be royal stables. For centuries
        elephants were the superpower here. For industries like lumber (all old
        wood logging is now banned here), and even more: for war. Imagine a fully
        armored elephant charging you: screwed. Working with and riding these
        amazing animals, you really get a sense of their power, their toughness. At
        first the mahouts seemed to hit them too hard, but even affectionate pats
        need to come pretty hard through that skin. These aren’t big horses with
        trunks. An elephant is more like a Sherman tank.</p>
    <p> Solid. Pushing a d pulling a d tugging and hitting mean almost nothing to
        them. And even the babies are easily strong enough to end me. They are
        very smart, but still smart animals, and do well with boundaries and
        guidance.</p>
    <p>I have also been told that circus elephants typically outlive zoo
        elephants, for the very obvious reasons of purpose and stimulation. A well
        cared for elephant can live into her eighties. Here at this kraal there are well
        over a hundred elephants, many of them rescues, but many also from
        breeding. I am told that they have had nearly fifty successful deliveries, and
        we are shown an elephant ready to deliver any time. </p>
    <p> Other rescues have appeared here. Several dogs, a couple cats, including
        one with feline AIDS in seclusion, a macaque injured in the wild now living
        well with no legs and one arm, and a crocodilefish in a tank of water. Quite
        a collection.</p>
    <p>On the outside wall of the hut I am in is a soberingly high water mark. Just
        three months ago this area was devastated by floods. It’s an even more
        dramatic sight at the mahout village, </p>
    <p>A hut from the Mohout village. That brown line up there is the water line
        from the recent flood
        where much of the damage has yet to be repaired. There’s talk of putting
        the whole village on stilts, but cost aside, that’s quite a time consuming
        venture. </p>
    <p>Well, after a long day we all lounge together over drinks and talk about
        everything and nothing, our bellies full of delicious Thai food. Tomorrow
        starts early, so in ones and twos we all drift to bed. </p>
    <p>Safe journey. </p>
