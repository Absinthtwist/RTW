    <h1>Day 90: How To Squeeze Three Months Worth Of
        Museum In To Five Hours or Damn My Legs Hurt</h1>
    <h2>Monday 4 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Paris, France</h3>  
    <p>Ninety days. It feels like a very full span of time. A lot has happened. And
        my count gets me home in sixteen days. So just a hair over two weeks. Hard
        to believe.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I am out the door at to the metro by 0750. My legs are definitely
        sore, but worse are my ankles, not sure why. And that right foot again.
        Hurting in all the right ways for me to know I’ve messed it up properly a d
        there may be a reckoning down the road. But for today I can stop bitching
        and just keep walking. By 0805 I am in line to enter the Louvre, and I have
        a seat on the pavement as I wait. The doors open promptly at 0900 and I
        am off and running. Right now the halls are near empty but I fully expect
        this place to be packed, so I make the call to race to one exhibit ignoring
        entire halls of work for now. Leonardo Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. It’s a
        charming little painting, and a bit enigmatic, which is the only reason I can
        think of for the painting’s profound fame. It’s nice, but there are many far
        more powerful works.</p>
    <p>That done, I can move with a little more ease. Maybe not a relaxed pace, I’d
        be here for months, but not running. I’ve blocked off the entire day for this,
        and even left room to come back if needed. I have no idea how long the
        Louvre will take me or how long I can go before my brain melts.</p> 
    <p>I am able to take in the lovely Venus de Milo and the breath- taking Nike of
        Samothrace virtually undisturbed, but by 1100 the bodies are pressing in
        and by 1130 I’m taking a seat for a breather. No time to rest, I keep
        pressing, too many paintings and sculptures to dream of naming them all.
        Many works I no doubt missed. Others I moved past too fast. But I am
        absorbing a great deal. At 1230 I take a break for lunch (breakfast, really. I
        didn’t stop to eat this morning, I should know better). I look at the
        restaurant menu prices and give it a pass for the more reasonable outdoor
        cafe, having a curry chicken baguette. It’s cold and gray outside but at least
        it comes with a chair. About half way through my lunch the rain begins, but
        I refuse to budge until I finish eating, moving to a table with an umbrella.
        Everyone else gives up, and as I exit I see no one else eating.</p>
    <p>By 1245 I am back in the galleries, and by 1400, confident that I have done
        my best and seen nearly every room, I take my leave of the most impressive
        museum in the world. My brain is baked and my feet and ankles feel like
        murder, but as its still so early, I feel odd just calling it a day. So I pick amore relaxed goal, something close to my heart and easier to digest. My
        mind made up, I trek to the metro and am on my way.</p>
    <p>At 1435, I arrive at the Cinémathèque Française, the French Cinema
        Museum. I see several locals and hear very little English. Score. They have a
        special exhibition on Tim Burton, so better and better. I feel that Burton is
        a fantastic talent but that in recent years he has lost his fire and is resting
        on his laurels. This exhibit does exactly what it should and reminds me why
        I loved him from the start. Filled with various drawings and figurines and
        props from his works, both filmed and too peculiar to ever see the big
        screen, seen in total it is quite a body of work. My favorite section of the
        exhibit is a large frame filled with rows and rows and rows of cocktail
        napkins filled with the unmistakable inimitable scribblings of Burton, odd
        figures and moments, both familiar and unfamiliar Jack and Sally from
        Nightmare Before Christmas being favorite standouts.</p> 
    <p>Downstairs is the museum proper, which includes many pieces of pre-
        cinema hardware like the zoetrope machine. Highlights in this gallery
        include the head of Norman Bates’ mummified mother from Hitchcock’s
        Psycho and (the real gem) the great girl robot from Fritz Lang ‘s Metropolis.</p>
    <p>I’m pretty close to home, so I walk back toward my hostel and stop for
        dinner. Something tells me once I climb those six flights of stairs I’ll be
        done for the day. At 1635 I step into a cafe and have a croque monsieur and
        a hot chocolate. Back at the hostel, I end up hanging out with my three
        Canadian roommates, talking, laughing, and sharing beers through the
        night. Around 2200 we all go downstairs to grab some quick food, then it’s
        lights out as we all have an early morning coming.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow: Notre Dame.</p> 
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
