    <h1>Day 91: A Really Good Day</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 5 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Paris, France</h3>  
    <p>Another early wake up and a farewell to my Canadian friends, then I am out
        the door by 0730. My right foot is killing me, just like it was back on Japan,
        and I’m left assuming I’ve repeated the same injury. The reality I have to
        accept is that I’ve been going all too fast here in Paris, after having gone all
        too fast all through Italy. I think the right call, however upsetting, is to take
        Versailles and Chartres off the itinerary, slow down a bit, and savor what I
        have.</p>
    <p>Well anyway, regardless of any sore foot, I decide to walk this morning. The
        foot tends to be worse after rest and improves after walking a few minutes. I
        follow the canal up and around the Bastille, then back down to the Seine. I
        know I still have the advantage of time and I choose to savor my walk. I
        progress to Ile Saint-Louis then on to Ile de la Cité and find a view well and
        truly worth savoring: Notre Dame Cathedral. It’s 0830 and hardly a soul
        around, and I walk right in to the Cathedral without any wait.</p>
    <p>I have heard of Notre Dame ‘s beauty for years, and I have seen some truly
        amazing things on this trip. All the same, as I enter the cathedral, more
        than impressed or wowed or anything like that, I am deeply moved, and I
        wipe a tear from my eye. Perhaps it’s the cathedral itself, perhaps seeing it
        without the overwhelming ever-present press of the crowd. It doesn’t really
        matter. I go down the isle, and from chapel to chapel. Somewhere a priest is
        performing a mass. I see the statues, one to Joan of Arc. I see the places
        where the great stone columns still retain the colorful paints, giving hint to
        what this all once looked like ( NOT naked gray stone). I take my time, and
        with a little sadness, depart.</p> 
    <p>I take my place in the line to climb the Notre Dame tower, and very soon,
        1000, I am, once again, climbing stairs. I climb to the level of the gargoyles,
        where the city spreads out before me. There’s a tiny door to the side where
        more stairs can be climbed and I get a good look at the massive bell. Back
        outside with the gargoyles, I am led to another staircase climbing to the
        very top of the south tower. It this point panoramic vistas of Paris just
        aren’t having the same effect as a couple days ago, and soon I begin the long
        hike down. By 1100 I am back on earth, outside the cathedral.</p>
    <p>I take a brief moment to check out the “Zero Point,” a circular plaque on the
        ground a few yards from the door to Notre Dame which is the official center
        of Paris, and the point from which everything is measured. From here I
        cross to the Left Bank and go directly to Shakespeare &Co, a trulymarvelous bookstore that exceeds all my fantasies of the most artsy and
        intellectual, dusty tome-filled, sitting in a chair reading poetry-kinda book
        store. This is no Barnes & Noble.</p>
    <p>I walk over to the Saint Michel, a small plaza and water fountain, decorated
        with the archangel Michael. This spot has many many times in the past
        been ground zero for rebellions and uprisings. Very close to the Sorbonne,
        which is one of if not the very first university in the world. Lots of artists
        and intellectuals. Rebellion in a can, just add water (or lots of wine, more
        likely). In either a gesture of mistrust or just irony, the Palace of Justice, the
        legal center of France, is just across the bridge.</p> 
    <p>I stop to grab a bite to eat, you’d think I’d learn that skipping breakfast is
        dumb, but here I am again. I have a crepe with an egg, cheese and ham. A
        change from the dessert crepes I’ve had in the past, and both enjoyable and
        filling. With food in my belly, I cross over back to Ile de la Cité to see Sainte
        Chapelle, but discover that it will be closing soon for a couple hours but
        open this afternoon. So informed, I grab the metro and ride west to the next
        station and come to Musée d’Orsay. There is a tremendous line, but as I
        bought the Paris Museum pass, I walk in after a three minute wait. Can’t
        beat it.</p>
    <p>This isn’t Louvre sized, but it’s still a huge museum, filled with amazing
        stuff. In a perfect world I should slowly proceed, stay for maybe 90
        minutes, then go, come back in a couple days and repeat for a couple weeks
        till I’ve seen it all. And the Louvre should take at least a month, more like
        three, and I ran through it in five hours. So I’m sad to say that the
        wonderful Musée d’Orsay will get my best under the circumstances. That
        said, I move at a solid pace through some lovely statuary before hitting the
        main course: Toulouse Lautrec, Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh and many many
        others. It’s fantastic. A feast.</p>
    <p>One last note: students. I noticed this in the Louvre as well: there were
        several entire classroom-fulls of French students, ranging from seven to
        seventeen in age, being led through these museums in groups, the older
        students taking notes, the younger ones seeming to color in a workbook
        with images from the museum, all led by teachers speaking, in rapid
        French, with obvious and infectious passion and intensity, hands gesturing
        all about the chosen painting. I think it’s way cool. I wish I had had some of
        that when I was I school, I might have stayed awake more.</p> 
    <p>By 1530 I am exiting the museum and I take the metro back to Sainte
        Chapelle. I find two lines there, one going down the block, the other with
        half a dozen people and moving quickly. Nothing to lose, I get in the short
        line and am through near instantly. Turns out there are supposed to be two
        lines, people just assume. Bahh Bahh. From there I’m in a lage courtyard of
        the Justice building, constructed, god only knows why, around Sainte
        Chapelle. Well, I suppose I should be glad they didn’t tear it down. So
        there’s this thirteenth century church surrounded by a nineteenth century
        building. Bizarre.</p>
    <p>The chapel itself, a fraction of the size of Notre Dame, is, from the outside
        anyway, just as gothic or even a bit more so. Nice touches here and there,
        but not extraordinary. The entrance leads you into a beautiful room, very
        gothic with the vaulted ceilings, but strikingly different from Notre Dame in
        that it is all rich with color! Fabulous! It was restored in the nineteenth
        century (after being well trashed in the French Revolution), so this may not
        be the original paint job, but it is faithfully done, and is amazing to see.
        Curious to see what else may be here in this church, I move on to the
        staircase leading up.</p>
    <p>Oh.</p> 
    <p>My.</p>
    <p>God.</p>
    <p>While I know this building is made of stone, I know it, I don’t see it. All I
        see, in every direction, is a vision of glorious light and color. The walls are
        almost completely made of the most beautiful stained glass, much of it
        original. And everywhere I do see stone, the floors, the great vaulted ceiling,
        the shafts running up between windows, all beautifully painted. This really
        is one of those times: nothing I say, no matter how perfectly I describe, nopicture I post can begin to convey the true awe and glory and beauty of this
        place. This is it: this is why I travel, why I get up in the morning. My arm
        could get chopped off this evening and I would still he hard pressed to call
        this a bad day (but let’s not test that theory thank you).</p> 
    <p>By 1645 I’m back out on the street, wondering what could possibly make an
        impression on me after all this, when I stumble upon one of the few
        remaining absolutely wonderful Art Nouveau Metropolitain subway signs.
        No, not breath taking, but gorgeous all the same. A smile comes to my lips.
        Yeah, this is Paris. There’s still plenty to impress me.</p>
    <p>I relax around Sainte Michel and sip a beverage as I look over my goals for
        Paris. It’s official: Versailles And Chartres are off the table. It’s sad, but
        better this way. Quality beats quantity. And I’m getting plenty of quantity
        anyway. Around 1800 I start the very gradual process of walking back to my
        hostel, stopping in a fromagerie to grab some delicious cheese (the man
        said it was sheep cheese, no clue what type) and a Boulanger to pick up a
        baguette flute. It’s a simple dinner but a fantasy one, and all I need. A
        perfect cap to a truly amazing day.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
