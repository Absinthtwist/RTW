    <h1>Day 93: Old Friends</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 7 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Paris, France</h3>  
    <p>Today I am a total bum and sleep in. It’s quite nice, if a bit foreign. At 1030
        I get a call from my good friend, Sam, who has just flown in to Paris. Sam
        and I have been good friends for years and years. He’s the guy who gave me
        the travel bug to start with, what with our long talks into the night about
        art, and life, and about all his amazing travels to incredible places. Sam’s
        been to well over one hundred countries, though admittedly his expense
        account is a bit more liberal than mine. We’ve been talking about
        connecting somewhere along this journey from before I even started, and as
        his girlfriend lives here in Paris, it’s the perfect fit. We decide on dinner at
        1930 in the 15th arrondissement.</p>
    <p>After that call, and remembering my noon lunch reservation (apparently ill
        be eating well today), I pull myself out of bed and am on my way. I arrive
        promptly at my lunch restaurant, La Fermette Marbeuf. This will be
        expensive, but I justify it as both a good meal and the price of a museum.
        Opened in 1900, this place is a masterpiece. A perfectly beautiful Art
        Nouveau dream, the likes of which I never thought to see in this world, in
        beautiful shades of greens, pale creams, and gold. Like being in a stylized
        greenhouse, a harmony of industrialism and nature. As for the food, while I
        could have kept it light, I decided to just aim for the deep end and dive head
        first. A glass of Chablis and a veal chop, served with the most delicious
        mushrooms and potatoes, finished off with profiteroles smothered in a
        sauce of freshly melted chocolate. Yes, expensive, but so what. Better to be
        poor when I get back and have the memories.</p>
    <p>At 1350, I move on. It’s a bit of a metro ride, and by 1440 I arrive at Père
        Lachaise Cemetery. It’s raining, so I pull out my umbrella and enter the
        cemetery. I know there are some famous people here, and if I see them
        great, but for me, the value I this place is not in the name- dropping. It’s
        quite charming, though I confess nothing beats Highgate Cemetery in
        London. All the crypts are above ground. Perhaps the remains are interred
        beneath, but the almost house-like crypts above steal the show. The rain
        picks up and becomes overpowering, so I head back to the metro after a few
        more minutes. I return to my hostel for a dry-off and a nap.</p> 
    <p>By 1830 I am back out under sunny skies near the 15th arrondissement
        walking through Rue Cler, as cute as can be. I walk past some amazing
        views of the Eiffel Tower before eventually coming to my 1930 dinner with
        Sam and his lady. Alas for her, as lovely as she is, for Sam and I, old friends,
        instantly got to talking and never stopped. Life, the world, and our favorite
        topic, travel. I was treated to some French classics including escargot and
        foie gras, both of which I enjoyed. All too soon the hours melted away, and
        we parted, agreeing to meet again tomorrow. I catch the metro and make it
        back to my hostel around midnight.</p>
        <p>Safe journey!</p>
