    <h1>Day 88: The Final Disney</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 2 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Paris, France</h3>  
    <p>So today is a day for being a kid. Usually this is all too easy for me, but I
        must say I’ve been pushing pretty hard the past few days, my legs are sore,
        my feet are brutal with large blisters coming in, but it’s all about mindset.
        Your focus determines your reality, right? Owe!</p>
    <p>So my feet killing me, I am up and out the door by 0800. After exploring
        the station briefly I buy a ticket, and by 0900 I am in the Disney Village
        area. There are the two parks, Disneyland of course, and a Disney Studios. I
        am content to focus just on Disneyland. At 0930 they let us on to Main
        Street, the other areas roped off except for hotel guests. Membership always
        has its etc. But come 1000, the ropes are withdrawn, and just like a child, I
        make my way through the open castle gate.</p>
    <p>Fantasyland is nice, but it’s always been a bit light, I’m pushing to the back
        of the park, hoping most people start at the front. There are crowds here,
        but nothing like the crazy mobs at Tokyo Disneyland, running like they
        were in A Hard Day’s Night. The first ride I stop at, in a completely
        different place than in the other parks, is the Pirates of the Caribbean. The
        line is short, and I’m on in fifteen minutes. The ride itself has most of the
        same elements as Pirates in other parks, just shuffled around. It works well
        enough, I’d say.</p> 
    <p>By 1030 I am making my way to the Indiana Jones ride, nowhere near
        where it would be in other parks, and nothing at all like the original. The
        original Indiana Jones ride is underground with lots of mood and
        animatronics. This is a roller coaster! And much to my shock and against all
        my assumptions of Disney, it may be small and pretty mild, but this is a real
        roller coaster, with a full inversion loop! It’s nothing like Magic Mountain,
        but quite fun all the same.</p>
    <p>Not knowing when this fast line streak will end or if I’m just blessed, I walk
        with all speed to Big Thunder Mountain. This is closer to expectations,
        taking almost an hour. Also noteworthy is the fact that the line and load for
        the ride is on the mainland, while Thunder Mountain is in the middle of a
        big lake like Tom Sawyer’s Island usually is. As the train starts and finishes
        you go through a tunnel under the water. Also of note: the great T-Rex
        skeleton for the wow-finish for the ride is not actually a part of the ride. On
        the opposite shore of this lake is the T-Rex skeleton in a colorful geological
        formation. I can only guess they initially intended the train to go over there
        and that somewhere along the line plans changed.</p>
    <p>Having had almost no food to speak of since last evening, at 1145 I look for
        a restaurant but they are all closed. I can’t seen to find anything resembling
        real food, and settle for sugar in the form of a soda and brownie then move
        on to Phantom Manor, the local name for Haunted Mansion. This is
        interesting for the reemphasizing of the Haunted Bride story line initially
        intended then scrapped back in the original. This ride seems a little more
        creepy: more skeletons, less humor. That is, until the last minute when they
        go nuts and pull all the stops and the grave yard turns into a comically
        haunted Old West town (we are in Frontierland), which really doesn’t fit.</p> 
    <p>I continue through the park, enjoying the differences, but the real fun in in
        Discoveryland (Tomorrowland), which had a steam-punk Jules Verneemphasis which really works. In Space Mountain, the astronaut theme is
        removed in favor of a big brass and rivets cannon which launches you to the
        moon! Again, this ride is quite a bit more intense than its original,
        including an inversion, and that wonderful canon launch!</p>
    <p>All in all I have a fantastic time but am worn out. I’ve done all I really want
        to do, so by 1730 I am making my retreat. Back in Paris, I grab a bite to eat
        after trying with no luck to locate a laundromat. Tomorrow that must be my
        priority. I am in bed by 2200 and hope to sleep in and let my feet rest a bit.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
