    <h1>Day 94: Farewell To Paris</h1>
    <h2>Friday 8 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Paris, France</h3>  
    <p>So I’m awake and out the door by 0815 with hopes that I can do laundry
        and make it back in time to drop off my clothes. This may be naive but
        worth a shot. And if not, well at least I’m wearing real shoes this time. I’m
        pretty tired, but I don’t really see sleeping in again for a while. Perhaps an
        afternoon nap. This is the home stretch, less than two weeks left, and I
        don’t mind saying I’m worn out, but I don’t want to miss anything.</p>
    <p>I make it back in plenty of time, 0950, and take a power nap before setting
        out at 1100. I exit the metro and step out across the street from the famous
        Moulin Rouge. I imagine seeing the show would be entertaining, though
        between you and me, I much prefer being on a personal, intimate basis with
        half naked women who dance for me. The money thing just ruins it for me.
        That said, much of this street, an unapologetic sex district, is wasted on me.
        Interesting on an anthropological level and that’s really about it. I move on,
        walking up the hill into Montmartre, which becomes more and more
        charming and more and more over-run with tourists with every step. Near
        the top of the hill is an open air art gallery with dozens of artists making
        and selling hundreds of paintings and drawings, mostly of tourist stuff like
        the Eiffel Tower and the Arc du Triomphe, but some of it is quite good. And
        a little further up the hill, in bright white stone, stands the Basilica of Sacre
        Couer.</p>
    <p>I enter Sacre Couer, and find it quite lovely. Very neoclassical in
        appearance, the great mosaics on the wall beautifully blend into what I can
        only call Art Nouveau. Not what I expected. Outside the Basilica is a grand
        staircase leading down the hill, back to the main boulevard of Montmartre.</p> 
    <p>I stop for a panini, and am captivated by the sight of people dropping €100
        on a shell game on the street. You know the drill, only updated a bit. Three
        black circles, like plastic coasters, one of which has a white spot face down.
        The guy moves the coasters around and people place bets on where the
        white spot is hid. Watching, a bit removed eating my panini, I have no
        trouble whatever keeping track of that white spot and am a bit stunned by
        people giving up €100 so pointlessly and yes, the tiniest bit tempted at the
        sight of people doubling that same €100 in a second. The guy tries to pull
        me in, but I just smile. I have every confidence that when my €100appeared, that white spot would vanish, and the only question I am left
        with is how many of these people supposedly betting money are actually in
        on the scam.</p>
    <p>Well, no richer but no poorer, I head back to the hostel at 1515, to dry out
        from the occasional rain and rest. I send a text to Sam, and we agree to
        meet up at St Michel at 1700. After a power nap, I start walking.</p>
    <p>The walk along the Seine is always lovely, the view of Notre Dame never
        getting old, but without warning the rain comes in full force and I am
        soaked. A few minutes later it fades away, and by 1700 and st Michel, I’m
        practically dry. Advantages of synthetic fabrics.</p> 
    <p>Sam and is lovely lady friend show up shortly after 1700, and we stop for a
        moment to marvel at a busker playing a piano right there in the square in
        front of the st Michel statue, the ground still wet from rain. He’s quite good,
        actually.</p>
    <p>We walk through the lively streets a while. Though not officially pedestrian,
        a car does pass through now and again, this street is owned by foot traffic,
        and is quite crowded. We pass by a gothic cathedral that none of us has
        been in, st Germaine, and give it a go. It’s a little run down, but that seems
        to make it all the more compelling. It still bears the faded and chipped paint
        upon its walls and columns, even a field of stars on its high ceiling. Quite
        beautiful.</p>
    <p>We wall a bit further and stop at Cafe de Flore, which I am told is quite
        famous, and seems to pop up in every French movie. We soon get lost in
        conversation as the food piles up. I have a delicious omelette, and Sam
        thrusts a salad at me as well. But without a doubt, the best part of the meal
        was the hot chocolate viennese, which does NOT taste like it was made from
        a powder, but is stunningly rich and delicious, like drinking melted
        chocolate.</p> 
    <p>We decide to take in a movie, and look through our options to something
        we hope will be in English that is not hopelessly Hollywood. We settle on a
        film called Two Days in New York and start walking to the theatre. The
        movie, staring, written and directed by Julie Delpy, costarring Chris Rock,
        turns out to be half English (with subtitles) and half French (NO subtitles).
        But hey, here we are, why back out now. While I no doubt lost a great deal ifsubtlety, I followed the film pretty well. It’s a story of a French woman and
        her American boyfriend as her crazy French family comes to visit.
        Wackiness ensues.</p>
    <p>The movie lets out at 2150 and we part ways, promising great shared
        adventures soon, a promise I mean to keep. From there I make the walk
        along the bank of the Seine, no hurry, watching the sky darken and the
        locals and tourists go about their way. Eventually the rain applies its
        pressure and I say so long to the Parisienne night. Until we meet again.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
