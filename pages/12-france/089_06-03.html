        Through Paris Wearing Flip-Flops Carrying His Laundry
        In A Bag & Part II: A Whole Lot Of Steps And A Hell Of A

    <h2>Sunday 3 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Paris, France</h3>  
    <p>Today I sleep in. I take my time and am up and out by 0950, wearing my
        sandals and carrying my dirty laundry in a draw-string stuff-sack. Everyone
        I have met in Paris has been wonderful: friendly, helpful, english speaking
        and patient. The stereotype of the rude Frenchman is an honor held only by
        the desk staff of my hostel. I asked them where I could do laundry near by
        and they said “left” with a wave before turning away. Well, armed with that
        useful information and unable to find any laundromats to the left (or right)
        of my hostel, I put google to work and I am on the metro to the district of
        Marais, a famously Jewish neighborhood. I start a load of laundry, and by
        1050 I am sitting in a cafe a few yards down the road sipping expresso,
        eating a delicious croissant.</p>
    <p>At nearly 1100, the weather is rather overcast. An occasional fine rain
        drizzles here and there. It’s 61f right now, and I’m thinking that with my
        coming destinations, this may be the warmest weather I see for a while.
        Might be wise to pick up a sweater.</p>
    <p>My laundry finishes easily, and by noon I am back at my hostel to drop off
        my laundry and change my shoes. Alas, the rude man at the desk hasinformed me that all rooms are closed until 1500 for cleaning. I suppose I
        could press the matter if I yelled, but it is beneath me to be a dick when not
        absolutely necessary. And as I have no interest whatever in waiting the
        three hours doing nothing, I sling my laundry stuff-sack over my shoulder
        and head back to the metro.</p> 
    <p>I consider my options a moment, then head to the Arc de Triomphe. It’s a
        lovely sight. A friend told me this offers some amazing views from the top,
        do after walking around the arch a bit, up I go. It’s about 260ish steps to the
        top, not too shabby, and the views do not disappoint.</p>
    <p>Moving on, by 1300 I am walking down the Champs Élysées in my flip-flops
        with my laundry bag. It’s quite lovely, with a great wide street and great
        wide walks on both sides. I decline to stop at any of the cafes, and keep
        walking until I enter the Place de la Concorde. It’s quite charming with a
        couple of lovely water fountains (walk downwind of fountains at your own
        risk).</p>
    <p>At this point I’m quite hungry, so somewhere around the Tuileries I stop in
        an overpriced touristy looking place and just accept it for what it is. I order
        the bœuf bourguignon and an amstel, and finish up with the creme brûlée.
        Way expensive, but what the hell.</p> 
    <p>After lunch I walk through the Tuileries, a charming park that used to be
        the cool hang out for the wealthy and powerful three centuries ago. I find a
        playground filled with happy children playing and I smile: this is what
        healthy revenge looks like. Vive la Revolution! I head over to the Orangerie
        only to remember I never picked up my Paris Museum Card, and the line is
        ridiculously long. I walk around a bit and consult google before I find a
        place to get a museum card, underneath the Louvre no less.</p>
    <p>At this point it’s 1620 and I miss my shoes. So I grab the metro back to the
        hostel, finally putting down my laundry. It’s too late today to take
        advantage of my museum card, and I am reviewing my options, when a new
        roommate enters. We do the intros, Jarred from Canada, and we decide
        that this is the perfect time to go check out the Eiffel Tower and we head
        out together at 1800.</p>
    <p>We have a bit of a mix-up with the metro and end up walking the last
        kilometer, which is really just fine with me, better to see the approach. At adistance, it’s tall but not extremely tall, but this is a deception. As you get
        closer, the hugeness of the Eiffel Tower becomes inescapable. If yesterday
        at Disneyland I saw some lovely steam-punk, it was as nothing to this, the
        real thing, the true masterpiece. The grace and beauty and hugeness all take
        me by surprise.</p> 
    <p>The line is huge, so I hold a place while Jarred goes to investigate our
        options. He comes back and we discuss. The long line is for the elevator to
        the second platform. There is a much smaller line for the staircase and leg-
        power. We both agree and leave this huge line and are soon climbing. The
        climb is fantastic, with great views both of the surrounding park and of the
        structure itself. By 2030 we have reached the first platform, at the level of a
        twenty story building. We stop for some photos, marvel at the presence of a
        restaurant and a cafe (€5 coke), then start climbing again. With a grand
        total of 674 steps and the equivalent of a Forty story building, we reach the
        second platform at 2100. The view of Paris is phenomenal. Jarred heads up
        to the third level, the very top, by elevator and I chill out waiting for him. In
        the best of times elevators give me the willies, and after climbing this far
        and seeing the elevator, I decide my honor will remain if I give the third
        level a pass.</p>
    <p>Jarred returns, quite impressed, and we make our descent. By 2200 we
        touch ground, just as the sky is darkening, and seconds later the tower
        alights, twinkling beautifully, like a sparkling diamond, for about five
        minutes before settling for a steady romantic light scheme. Jarred and I
        head to a food stand where I order a banana Nutella crepe and he follows
        suit. As seems to be the norm here, the crepe is easily the best I’ve ever had.
        With that we start walking back to the appropriate metro station and are
        back to our hostel by 2340. I don’t mind admitting that I’m tired. Early
        morning tomorrow for the Louvre. Hope my legs are good for it.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
