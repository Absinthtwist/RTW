    <h1>Day 92: Caverns Dark And Waterlilies Light</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 6 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>Paris, France</h3>  
    <p>I am awake and out the door by 0930. I stop and buy more metro tickets to
        keep me moving, and a pain au chocolate to keep me fat. By 1010, I am
        stepping out onto the Paris city streets across from the great Paris Opera
        house. It’s pretty over-the-top, fantastic to look at, if a bit excessive. But
        hey, if you’re gonna be a bear, be a grizzly, right? As this is a working
        theatre and they are doing some repairs or some such to the stage, the
        auditorium is off limits, but the lobby area I have free access to is
        extraordinary. Neoclassicism was all about looking like the Classical era,
        only doing it bigger better faster more to prove we’re cooler. Or at least
        that’s my impression. An impression to link oneself to a previous art
        movement, providing continuity and justification, but at the same time
        transcending it. That’s this place.</p>
    <p>By 1100 I am back on the street and walking, unhurriedly, I don’t mind if I
        do less today, toward l’Orangerie Gallery. My camera starts giving me
        serious trouble and eventually just freezes up. Good thing I have a good
        camera on my phone.</p>
    <p>By 1145 I reach my destination and stroll right in. This really is a rather
        small gallery, though undoubtedly important. Downstairs has some
        fantastic works, but the building was created for the works upstairs. Two
        oval galleries, like a big figure-eight, with profoundly large floor to ceiling
        canvases covering all but the doors of these two round rooms, surrounding
        you in a space of color and light: Monet’s masterpieces, his great waterlilies.</p> 
    <p>The Orangerie doesn’t take long, and by 1245 I’m relaxing on a bench in the
        Tuileries. I review my options and decide my next stop is the Paris
        Catacombs. I step through the next metro station entrance and seem to
        walk forever down staircase after staircase, hallway after hallway. Not quite
        lost but feeling I should have just walked up on the surface. By 1415 I’m up
        on the streets if Paris again and feeling cranky, so I know my chocolate
        croissant breakfast has worn off. In no mood to bother with menus, I go
        right for the blasphemy: McDonalds. It’s as much a McDonalds as all the
        others, Paris doesn’t change it that much. Yeah, the Royale with cheese is
        there, and so too the beer, both of which I decline. I take my time with my
        crap food, then proceed to the Catacombs, waiting in the long line.</p>
    <p>By 1530, I am descending down the long spiral staircase. The Catacomb
        experience is about a two kilometer walk, and the first is rather mellow.
        Bare stone walls and low ceilings, lights dim and few and far between, just
        enough to see by. There are a couple of interesting points where someone
        carved little castles from the rock, rather charming. Then comes the second
        kilometer, what most people came for. Darker by far than the first half, and
        quite damp: at some points the floor was a thin layer of mud over stone,
        water dripping from the all-too-low ceiling. And of course, the bones.
        Running out of room, the Parisians of two hundred years ago emptied
        cemeteries of their bones and neatly stacked them all here. Thousands upon
        thousands upon thousands of bones lines of skulls stacked upon a wall of
        femurs. The Cappuccin Monks in Rome were certainly the most decorative
        with bones, but this place wins overwhelmingly, both for sheer vast
        numbers and for truly spectacular ambiance. Very creepy, very cool. Walls
        of bones to either side, the damp dripping air, the low ceiling, all hard to
        beat.</p>
    <p>By 1635 I step out into the light, and walk north. I might make it in time to
        get into the Pantheon, but I’m not gonna run. Either I make it yes or no. I
        walk through the Latin Quarter, which really is quite as cool as they say, I
        can see my hostel over by Gare de Lyon is nowhere near as cool as this
        place. By 1725 I reach the Pantheon, which is not really religious, despite
        the name, nor does it look at all like the Panthon in Rome. It’s quite lovely,
        very Neoclassical in appearance, very much a “look how cool we are” sort of
        thing. There’s a touch of the “martyrs of the revolution” feel as well, which
        always strikes a chord with me, but somehow reminds me of Mao’s
        Mausoleum in Beijing, which kinda kills the patriotic mood for me. I step
        out and have a seat on the steps, where down the street a couple kilometers,
        easily visible, stands the Eiffel Tower, which I confess still makes me smile.</p> 
    <p>I keep walking north, walking through the Latin Quarter, past the
        Sorbonne, and at 1820 I am back in front of Notre Dame and decide to step
        in. There is a mass, so I have a seat. The scent of incense wafts through the
        great room, and the sound of church organ and choral singing. Hard to
        beat.</p>
    <p>And that’s pretty much my day.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
