    <h1>Day Three: The Streets Of Hong Kong</h1>
    <h2>Friday 9 March 2012    </h2>
    <h3>Hong Kong, China </h3>

    <p>
I initially set my alarm for 0600 but decided against that, slept in till around
0830. I needed the extra rest. The hostel isn’t bad. Very clean, and many a hostel would
fail that basic standard. But the piping hot water will last you about 5 minutes of shower,
do don’t dawdle, and one could tap dance on this so-called mattress. I got the hostel wifi
set up and spent the morning uploading some photos, and then set out just before 1000.
It was quite a valuable lesson, as I hit the street and took more or less the same route asyesterday, only a few hours later in the day. Alive, vibrant. Much more exciting. I think
the pre-dawn start should be used a little more sparingly. Even if I’m excited, it’s better
to let the city warm up a bit.
    </p>

It’s a much nicer day, though still a bit cloudy. I took the gamble and went back
up to Victoria Peak but no joy: still pure clouds. I stopped and had Singapore Noodles,
which were barely thicker than thread and came with shrimp.
    </p>
    <p>
        A little unimpressive, truth told. After finishing the meal I found a rather colorful
and much cheaper and far more appealing looking noodle house. Oh well.
    </p>

    <p>
Upper Lascar Row
It becomes a little challenging to articulate exactly which neighborhoods or
districts I have seen, as I don’t rightly know. I know I walked. I know I saw many things,
and took many pictures and that later perhaps, with geotagged photos, I can better
reconstruct my route.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suffice it to say that all to often the best route is the one not planned. Through
some amazing markets of first tourist crap then plastic trinkets then fruits and
vegetables of every imagining, then to seafood, some of it still flapping around, finally
leading me to Man Mo Temple. I would like to take a moment, having seen all these
markets, to say how seeing all of this somehow makes the cacophony of San Francisco
and New York Chinatowns make more sense. This works here. Feels like it belongs here
more than the cars. In the states, this sort of thing, while fun, always felt disjointed. Out
of place. Go figure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyway, Man Mo Temple. There were signs saying no photos, which I initially
obeyed, but after I saw everyone taking pics, I gave in and took a couple. From there I
wandered through Lascar row, once known as Cat Street, filled with shop after shop andstall after stall of China’s and Hong Kong’s past. The classical past right up to worn out
typewriters. This is like heaven to me.
Time to have a wee breather.

    <h4>
        1745: 
Central Ferry Pier 7
    </h4>
    <p>
        
Having had such a wonderful experience with the ferry ride last night, I thought I
should expand upon it with something longer, and in daylight. it was just wonderful.
    </p>
<p>
    So much so, that I am seriously tempted to go again after dark, to get a better
view of something that no other city in the world can offer. A strange mixture of
Manhattan, San Francisco and Las Vegas. Only… you know… Asian. This will be my last
major experience in Hong Kong on this trip, and it sounds quite worthy. I am aware of
my next stop peripherally, but I won’t be distracted from this amazing city. I could
spend months unraveling its mysteries, and learn no more than a thimbleful of what is
to be known.
</p>
<p>
    Upon returning to land, I went to grab a bite and saw that my choices were
    limited. Hot dogs, hamburgers, or the rather curiously named KPC, which stands for
    kebabs, pizza, and curry. So taken aback by this unnatural combination that I had to
    investigate (and really, nothing else in the offing without a long walk). Walking up to the
    booth I could hear Indian music and the lady in the booth was clearly Indian. Lamb
    curry it is. And pretty darn good, too. Points lost for not eating Hong Kong cuisine, but a
    find is a find.

Just hopped a ferry. Not even sure where it goes. Felt the urge and followed it. At
a cost of about 30 cents in US dollars, I can afford to experiment. Not as polished or
pretty as the tour boat, and certainly a briefer ride. But super cheap. So… Take several
journeys. As many as needed. Sun sets in about 20 minutes.
</p>
<h4>    
    1950: 
    Kowloon

</h4>
<p>
Wandered around for an hour or so. Different flavor over on this side of the
water. More money, high class.
</p>
<p>
    Right now I’m sitting on the dockside, looking at the beautifully illuminated
Hong Kong skyline. In about 10 minutes there’s supposed to be a light show. I’m excited
to see what they do.
</p>
<p>
    The Symphony of Lights was pleasant enough, but really, you can’t surpass the
magic of that skyline. It’s a Tron sequel all by itself. I’m back at the hostel where I
transferred some photos and am now charging batteries before heading to sleep.
Thank you, Hong Kong. You were amazing. Tomorrow: Xi’an.
