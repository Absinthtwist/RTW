    <h1>Day Ten: Beijing to Kyoto</h1>
    <h2>Friday 16 March 2012</h2>
<h3>transition from Beijing, China to Kyoto, Japan</h3>
<h4>0430</h4>
<p>    A travel day. My flight leaves at 0840 and the nice folks at my hostel
    insisted that I should leave leave in plenty of time, four hours before my
    flight. Knowing what I know of Beijing traffic I can see their point, but at0400 the roads were bare. So here I am well before take-off, well before
    even check-in, and nothing for it but to wait.</p>
<p>While there are many wonders of Beijing that I shall miss, the air quality is
    not among them. Dry sooty air, constant nasal congestion and mild eye
    irritation. This city is hemmed in on three sides by mountains. Fantastic for
    Pre-Industrial military fortification, not so much for post industrial smog
    control. They’ve cleared the factories out of the city, but there are still so
    many cars and coal fires.</p>
<p>I’d also like to take a moment and compare my two mainland Chinese
    cities, Hong Kong is in a class by itself. Xi’an was enjoyable, but I would not
    seek to return. While parts of it were charming, much of the city is best
    described as “bombed-out” looking, like the site of an air raid. Buildings
    crumbling, filth and grime all too common. On more than one occasion I
    saw someone, in the middle of town, step behind a bush to empty a bladder.
    Some of this I just accepted as cultural difference, but Beijing was quite
    different. Perhaps it is just their tourist show-piece, but it was much
    cleaner. Less bombed-out. Some of that, I suppose, was from a general Pre-
    Olympic house cleaning. Both cities are seeing a significant building boom,
    I’m curious how they shall appear in a decade.</p>
<p>Oh, side note: I asked about the rare food items. I was told there is one
    market that sells all the crazy stuff, grilled grasshopper, what have you. I
    was further informed that very very few locals have any interest, mostly
    that stuff is for the tourists. I saw plenty of seafood on menus, beef,
    chicken, pork, of course Peking Duck, but nothing more exotic than that.
    While outside of Xi’an, near the Terracotta Warriors, I saw many vendors in
    the markets selling many things. A few of them sold rather disturbing
    looking animal furs, and I don’t mean mink. Think domestic. I declined to
    investigate further at the time.</p>
    <h4>1230: Busan International Airport, South Korea</h4>
<p>Three hour layover, waiting for flight to Osaka. It was such a pleasure to
    step into the restroom here and see it and smell it so immaculately clean. I
    don’t think I realized how rough China was until I got here. Hard to make a
    real sense of a place from an airport, but my initial impression is that I like
    South Korea is love to see more of this country, but it will have to be
    another occasion.</p>
<p>Had a little trouble with my ticket getting out of Beijing, had to make an
    international call to my travel agent. In retrospect it probably wasn’t
    anything serious, but it gives me more confidence in my agent, which is
    good.</p>
<p>Right now I am enjoying a super healthy lunch of Pringles and Gatorade
    while watching a Korean reality show with singing. Had a cucumber
    sandwich and rice porridge on the plane.
    Gonna be a bit of a wait.</p>
    <h4>1820:
        Kansai International Airport, Osaka, Japan</h4>
<p>Flight went well. I’m excited to be in Japan. I’ve felt a kinship with this
    culture since going to grade school in Gardena, surrounded by Japanese
    kids. My friends were Japanese. Many of the toys we played with were
    Japanese toys. Unlike China, where I knew exactly two words, I know…
    well, not very much Japanese, but more than two words. Perhaps as many
    as twenty or thirty words, which is a respectable start. I am currently sitting
    in the van waiting for my ride from Osaka to kyoto, which I imagine will be
    about two hours. Sigh. At least it’s better than a four month tall sailing ship
    cruise. Hmmm… That actually sounds awesome, never mind.</p>
