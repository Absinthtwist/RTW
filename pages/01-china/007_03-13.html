    <h1>Day Seven</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 13 March 2012</h2>
    <h3>Beijing, China</h3>
<p>
    Train pulled in around 0830. I considered walking the 4 miles to my hostel,
but the 25f weather changed my mind and I took a bus. The hostel itself has
some lovely atmosphere and looks to be in a fun neighborhood, I’ll explore
soon. Once again recharging batteries. Tempted to say to hell with my
schedule and go to see the Forbidden City now, but without camera
batteries seems kinda stupid.
</p>
<p>
    Well, after a little downtime, and with only my phone for a camera (until
batteries charge up), I could wait no longer and set out. I decided that I
would not go into the Forbidden City without my camera, a decision I
wisely adhered to. I wandered through an amazing labyrinth of markets
and food vendors, becoming more and more upscale, until I came to
Qianmen Dajie, called the “Emperor’s Road.” It had been cleared out by the
revolution then recently refurbished (read: rebuilt from scratch) in
preparation for the Olympics. It’s a lovely open-air mall with a beautiful
Chinese flair, but with unmistakable western influences. Many big name
western shops here, but also many more Chinese.
</p>
<p>
    At the northern end of this avenue is an amazing structure that looks as
though it a great gate to a wall that no longer exists. I don’t know about the
wall, but we are very close to the Forbidden City. There are two of these
gigantic gate structures, aligned with one another, and in a direct line to theForbidden City with Tiananmen Square in between, so it seems possible.
The street between me and the Square is quite a big one, and the crossing is
not over the street but under it. So through the underpass I go, through a
security screening, my daypack through the X-ray machine. The security
are patting down locals, but don’t seem terribly concerned with western
tourists. Among items blocked by security are cigarette lighters, and at this
and other security point there is a large plastic tub full of lighters. People
exit the secure zone and just grab one.
</p>
<p>
    Into Tiananmen Square. It’s pretty big. I seem to remember reading
somewhere that its the largest such square, beating out the Place de
Concorde in Paris. Much of the southern portion is taken up by a huge
building which is the final testing place of Chairman Mao. As I understand
it, he explicitly stated his wish to be cremated. But there he is, his preserved
remains in a glass coffin on display. Alas, the Chairman was closed for
renovation and I did not have the pleasure.
</p>
<p>
    As I walked through the Square, no less than three conspicuously attractive
Chinese ladies came up to me wanting to practice their English. I have read
all about this on the web. They invite you to coffee or a drink – which I
politely declined – then either drug you and strip you down like a wrecked
car or they buy drinks and the bill comes up for hundreds of dollars and the
guy bringing the bill is huge and ready for trouble. I would like to not be
cynical. I would like to make new friends and have an amazing connection
with a stranger, or even a dashingly romantic whirlwind romance with an
exotic young lady. But I don’t wish to be robbed. Or worse. Images of
waking in a bathtub full of ice missing a kidney come to mind. I don’t want
to be too cautious. Just cautious enough.
</p>
<p>In the northern portion of the Square is a huge pillar, it has the look of
    honoring the martyrs of the Republic or the people or something like that,
    but I have no idea. To the west is a building I believe is the political body,
    legislature or the like. To the east is the Chinese Museum of History, which
    I make a note to check out. To the south is the avenue from which I came,
    and to the north is the Forbidden City, which is too important to see
    without a good camera.</p>
<p>From here I drift east toward the museum, and meet two more ladies
    wanting to practice their English. Must be a girls school they all come from.
    No guys, no clumps of people. It must be noted, however, that I am
    noteworthy. Well over six feet tall, many eyes scan me. I’ve just gotten used
    to it. And one one occasion, a young woman with her friend, with no
    English at all, was all too excited to see me and insisted on having herpicture taken with me. I was glad to comply, and they were off before I
    could take a pic of my own.</p>
    <p>
        The Chinese Museum of History is huge. Airport huge. 60 foot high ceilings
huge. Made to impress, clearly. The content was fantastic, and easy to
understand, with English text in signs. The display areas were easy to
follow, but getting from exhibit to exhibit was confusing and over-long. And
really, for all that vast scale, there could have been more substance. A good
museum, but more worried about making an impression than it has need to
be. I was there till they closed, about two hours, and saw perhaps a quarter
of their display material. The stuff I most wanted to see, the Ming dynasty
and the clash with western powers and the revolution, that timeframe, I got
barely a glimpse. Alas, perhaps on another occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Deciding on an early evening a d focusing on charging my batteries, literally
and metaphorically, I called it a night and read in the hostel common room
as Chinese tv played. The sports program was of no particular interest to
me, ice scaring, then later, martial arts, but the commercials kept pulling
my attention. The details were obviously Chinese, but what struck me was
just how similar these commercials were to American tv.
Anyway, that’s all for now. More adventures tomorrow.
Safe journey.
