<h4>1300: Hong Kong International Airport</h4>
<p>
    Waiting for my flight, about an hour early. As a rule I feel more comfortable
with early than with on time, even more so now given the circumstances.
There’s an odor of jet fumes wafting through this waiting area, which leaves
me less than pleased. This is the downstairs, obviously less fashionable,
section of the Airport, but it gets the job done.
</p>
<p>
    I’ve already left a few things aside from my back, things that seemed so
smart before starting, but declare themselves useless dead weight now that
I’m on the road. I have developed a system of what goes into which pocket,
and am pleased to report no pick-pocketing as yet.
I must say that Hong Kong was wonderful and painless. I need to be a little
bolder with my food choices, time to kick off the training wheels, otherwise
it was amazing. I’d go back without hesitation. A little sad I couldn’t make
Victoria Peak work, and that I was unable to see the giant Tian Tan Buddha,
but that’s how it is. Always something left undone. Always wanting more.
Bad sign otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    Correction: turns out that less than fashionable airport wing was just a bus
terminal. Took a bus to the actual gate area, and I take back all those not-
nice things I said. It’s a perfectly lovely airport with air ventilation, over-
priced shops and all the usual trappings. Flight should board any time.
</p>
<p>
    I am stirring in the plane now, waiting to take off. Strange note: the seat in
this plane, a Chinese carrier, is roomier than American carriers. I was
prepared for the worst.

    2015: Xi’an, Hostel
</h4>
<p>This place is amazing looking. Hard to describe. Not a hotel setup, not one
    building with many rooms. More like several smaller buildings with
    courtyards, walled in nicely.
    I’m gonna make an early night of it, make use of this extraordinarily
    comfortable looking bed.
