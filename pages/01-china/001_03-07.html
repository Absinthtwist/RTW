    <h1>Day One</h1>
    <h2>
        Wednesday 7 March 2012 
    </h2>
    <h3>

        Hong Kong, China
    </h3>

<p>
I’ve made it to my hostel intact and a bit worn out. Desperate need of a shower. That 14
hour flight is no joke. Not that I’m complaining. Could have been much worse. Seat next
to me was empty and I had just the wall in front of me. Two adequate meals. 3 movies, I
think, bit of a blur really.
</p>
<p>
As for Hong Kong, I have had only a glimpse. I enjoyed and can speak well of the train
system, and I did walk a short block to the hostel, but I have little enough to report of
the city itself. The people dress sharply, the train PA system says mind the gap just like
London, but in 2 languages.

<p>
The shower is now free, I’ll talk to you all later.
