    <h1>Day Eight</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 14 March 2012</h2>
    <h3>Beijing, China</h3>
<p>It was a chill morning. I didn’t check the temperature, but just yesterday at
    this hour it was 25f. I started my morning with a bracing shower in
    lukewarm water and cold air, had a breakfast of eggs and bacon with toast
    and orange juice -sorry, I want my breakfast before I get adventurous- then
    was out the door.</p>
<p>I discovered that Tiananmen Square was closed, and filled with parked
    cars. At a guess, I’d say their political office/legislative body was in session,
    but I didn’t ask. I proceeded to the Forbidden City, my focus for today. I
    found it as beautiful and as expansive as all the tales say. But while the
    exterior was immaculate, I found all too much of the palace to be covered in
    guano and soot, unkept. There were people about sweeping up, but to my
    mind, more care needs to be given to this world Heritage site.</p>
<p>I found it difficult to not keep thinking of the Bertolucci film The Last
    Emperor as I walked through the vast expanses of the palace, the classic
    image of the child emperor running out under the long red silk veil downmarble steps into a wide courtyard. This is the very place. I don’t mean the
    movie location, though it was that too, I mean the real place. From here
    China was ruled for five centuries, including that three year old little boy
    who was the end of the Chinese Imperial line. Inner courtyard and palace,
    outer courtyard and palace, layer upon layer, it was hard to keep it all
    straight in my head. And at the furthest end of the Forbidden City is the
    garden of the Emperor. Lovely, with many trees of unusual shape. My brain
    full of imperial architecture and having reached the north gate, I exited and
    began to walk. I acknowledge that by this point my feet and especially my
    ankles are pretty much always hurting. Price of doing business. I have good
    shoes with good insoles and I treat my feet well, but I am on them near
    constantly, so that’s that. The path I chose to take me back south was off the
    tourist main drag, which is often the most interesting way to go. I walked
    south past all I had seen, with a specific goal in my head. I had the pleasure
    of winding my way through an indoor “mall” which is stall after stall pushed
    one against the other with every kind of thing imaginable. Lots of clothes,
    bolts of cloth, silk. Plastic toys. Tools. I continued on my trek and came to
    the beautiful oasis of calm that was the park of the Temple of Heaven. Very
    lovely. As I understand it, the Emperor would come here at specific times of
    the year for ceremonies to promote good harvest, harmony, that wort of
    thing. Beautiful park grounds, beautiful temple. Similar in style to the
    Forbidden City, but different.</p>
<p>I made my way through the park and returned to Qianmen Dajie where I
    found a good looking midrange restaurant where nothing was in English,
    especially not the menu, except the word “welcome” on the door. There was
    only one person there who spoke any English, broken English at that. They
    handed me the menu and after I stared at it blankly for a moment and
    looked up with a frank, helpless smile, I think they got the idea. At this
    point, I think the entire restaurant staff was involved. They were all very
    welcoming, and more than a little anxious about how to do this. They
    wheeled over several carts one at a time. I would point to something
    interesting. My one translator knew enough to say “fish” or “pig” and we
    did just fine. I had a fish soup which was an excellent broth that I sipped
    down. At the bottom of the broth were thumb sized chunks of fish, of which
    I ate three or four. Not bad. Next was a green bean plate, with ginger I
    think. At first I thought it was small bits of garlic, but I’m pretty sure it
    wasn’t. This was served cold and I finished it right up. Then came a bowl of
    large marble sized pork meatballs (I can only imagine what part of the
    animal. Intestines and cartilage are both popular menu items here) served
    on a bed of what I assumed was tofu. I let the tofu go and ate almost all themeatballs. Quite enjoyable. I remember reading that in Chinese culture, you
    never want to do the clean-plate-club thing, especially when a guest in
    someone’s home: it means you are still hungry and they need to offer you
    more food. It carries through to restaurants I think. Either way, I’m sure I
    am doing enough impolite things without knowing it, why not at least try to
    be nice. Lastly was a large bowl of noodles with beef in a broth with
    seasoning. At one point I ate a slice of unmistakable ginger, other than that
    I can’t say what spices, but it was good. The noodles were wide, maybe 3/4
    inch, and with patience I could manage one or two at a time with the
    chopsticks. I was offered noodles or rice, and if I had thought about it I’d
    have gone for the rice. Joke all you want, but I at least have practice and
    reasonable success eating rice with chopsticks. Wet soupy noodles is a
    whole new world and I confess I ended up wearing at least a little if that
    broth. All part of the adventure</p>
<p>To round out my meal, I broke down and went to Starbucks, which was
    strikingly similar to the US version. If I had not known I was in China, I
    might not have known the difference. The menu items were all listed
    bilingually and that was about it. I had a mocha frap and damn if it didn’t
    taste identical. I took my chocolatey goodness to an outside table and
    people-watched as I sipped.</p>
<p>While I enjoy the up-scale upmarket of this avenue, I gotta say I really dig
    the back streets far more. When you find a market district, you can’t miss is
    it. Neon and exotic smells. People calling out their wares. They’re lazy about
    it nowadays and record their calls and set them on repeat. It’s more than a
    little annoying. They have the tourist stuff, sure, but also the food
    merchants, clothing, raw cloths and silk, table cloths seem quite popular,
    antiques, many things I don’t understand- and that’s ok. As the dusk
    descends, the neon and other lights start coming on. My experience so far
    has told me that you haven’t seen an Asian city until you’ve seen it at night.
    Maybe that goes for any city anywhere. I suspect it does.</p>
<p>That’s all for now.
    Safe journey.</p>
