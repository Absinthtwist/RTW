    <h3>Xi'an, China</h3>
    <h4>0815: 7 Sages Hostel</h4>
    <p>
        This hostel has a brochure quoting Hosteling International calling them
one of the world’s 10 most spectacular hostels. Difficult to argue. Maybe not
luxurious, but beautiful. I took the coward’s way out and ordered the
“American Breakfast.” 0800 is just too early for fish heads, or who knows
what. I’ll be adventurous after I’ve woken up a bit. I got a bottle of orange
juice, but I’d say no oranges were harmed in the production of this
beverage. More like an orange soda. Pleasant, but probably not as healthy
as I was looking for. So I’m sitting in a lounge area with big comfy chairs
and sofas and tables. There’s an old style stove in the middle of the room,
which appears to serve to warm the room and make tea. There’s a bowl of
what looks like coal next to it.

        The shower was surprisingly pleasant with plenty of hot water, benefit of
waking early no doubt. The bathrooms come with both western and chinese
style stalls, and the toilet paper is kept outside the stalls, so be sure to grab
what you need first. Probably best to carry a stash on me while here.
So after a reasonably pleasant breakfast, my guide arrived to pick me up for
my day’s adventure. March, it would appear, is not the high season here in
Xi’an, and I found that my tour group was a group of one.
Our first stop was to the remains of a six thousand year old village. Quite
interesting.

        From there we took a drive to a workshop where they make replicas of the
Terracotta statues using traditional techniques. Fascinating to see, and
there was much more there. Beautiful furniture, gorgeous porcelains, all
high quality. Needless to say I was brought here to buy something and I
didn’t disappoint.

    <p>
        I spent more than I should have, and nearly as much again to have it
shipped home. A nice thing to have waiting for my return.
From there it was to the big attraction itself, and it did was all it was made
out to be. I’ll skip the descriptions and let the images speak for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>After all that, I went back to the hostel to unwind for about an hour, then
        went out for an amazing walk. This is the Bell Tower, which matches with the near by Drum Tower. They
        are both from the Ming Dynasty, around the 14th century. The names speak
        for themselves: large bell in one, many large drums in the other.</p>
<p>
    From here I just followed my gut and ended up in the most amazing
district. Streets, alleys, mazes in and out, shops of every kind. It was
paradise.
