    <h1>Day Nine</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 15 March 2012</h2>
    <h3>Beijing, China</h3>
    <p>Up early waiting for tour guide to pick me up for my day’s adventure. To a
        Ming Dynasty Tomb, an “authentic” Chinese meal, and of course, The Great
        Wall of China. Biting cold out there.</p>
<p>A quick summary: Hong Kong was awesome. I could live there. Xi’an, while
    beautiful, I was ready to move on from. Beijing is quite a mystery, a
    pleasant one, and I could stay here another two weeks without concern
    (except perhaps that cold shower. Rather be a little stinky than face that
    again right now). All in all, this trip has been amazing, and I am one week
    in.</p>
<p>The tour included me and a young married couple from Brazil on holiday.
    Our tour guide, Ming, seemed knowledgable and friendly. Our first stop
    was at the edge of the mountains, the Tomb of a Ming emperor. This
    particular emperor moved the Capitol of China to Beijing, ordered the
    construction of the Imperial Palace (Forbidden City), and the construction
    if qthis elaborate tomb far from town. In appearance the architecture was
    quite similar to the Forbidden City. Quite nice.</p>
<p>rom here we went right to the main attraction. The Great Wall of China.
    Five thousand miles long (though much of it destroyed) and a thousand
    years old. Repaired many times over the centuries. The particular section
    we saw today was at Badaling, and includes a pretty damned steep hill
    section. I believe the guide said it was two thousand steps to the top of this
    area.</p>
<p>Along the wall are guardhouses, and I had the chance to go into one. The
    climb up is less a staircase and more of a ladder of brick at a slight angle. As
    for climbing the Wall itself, the steps were quite old and worn, rather steep,
    and surprisingly unevenly placed. One step would be a foot high, the next
    would be two inches. You absolutely must be aware as you take each step.
    And it’s quite a fall if you slip.</p>
    <p>You could see the wall snake over the hills into the horizon, and up over and
        beyond the edge of the hill upon which I climbed. It seemed to go on
        forever. I should also point out that were quite far north. The wall was built
        to deter Mongolia.</p>
<p>The breath misted, and a nearby river was half iced over. Chilly.
    After reaching the top of my particular hill I turned back. The trouble with
    wanting to walk something like the Great Wall is that short of hiking the
    full five thousand miles, there is no clear sense of completion. I did it,absolutely, but this wall is something to be met, it is far too much for me to
    conquer.</p>
    <p>From the Wall we were taken to Jade workshop and market. Clearly a plug,
        but still nice. The excuse for this visit was the restaurant in the back of the
        building made for tourists like us. A fixed menu of not terribly impressive
        food, very similar to what I had in Xi’an. Maybe this is how group tours
        work, maybe it’s a Chinese thing.
        Afterwards, we drove back into Beijing and through the Olympic village
        built for the 2008 games.</p>
<p>We couldn’t stop and look closely, but we got a nice drive-by. Here we
    stopped at what I know was another plug, but I was so enjoyable I don’t
    really care. Dr Tea. A very nice young lady walked us through the Chinese
    tea ceremony and let us sample several teas. I confess I spent some money.
    Worse than the immediate cost is the thought of how I’m going to get it
    home. Thankfully, my dear friend Linda, whom I will be meeting in Japan
    and who will be joining be in Cambodia has agreed to take a few things off
    my hands and ship them back to the states for me when she can. So I just
    need to carry this stuff for another week or two. It’s a tight fit, but I’ve
    already trimmed my pack quite a bit. I’m rather impressed by how much
    I’ve just let go and by how fast it happened. Once I get rid of these
    souvenirs by pack should be easier to haul around.</p>
    <p>
        Upon returning back to my hostel I had an afternoon shower, amazingly
pleasant with actual hot water and reasonable pressure, then began the
pack-up and made it an early night in favor of my 0330 wake up call.
Off for Kyoto in the morning.
Safe Journey!
