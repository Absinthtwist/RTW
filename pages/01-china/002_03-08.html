    <h1>Day Two</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 8 March 2012</h2>
    <h3>   Hong Kong, China</h3>

    
    <p>
        0630. Up by 0500 after a restless sleep. On street pre-dawn, perhaps 0545. A fine rain.
        Sky beginning to become a pale indigo, no glimpse of sun yet. The streets, silent at first,
        are coming slowly to life. Despite the light rain, the weather is pleasant but with a hint of
        humidity. About a third of the signs are in English, the rest presumably in cantonese.
        Seen a couple of McDonalds, noodle dish on the menu, a 7-11 here and there, and a few
        Circle-Ks, which steam their own dim sum. I have found a bench, out of the rain, to take
        a moment to sit and collect myself. My next destination is Victoria Peak.
        More later.
    </p>

    <p>
        0715. Hong Kong Park. Just a bit of unremarkable green on the map, but beyond
words in person. I am reminded unequivocally that this city was carved out of jungle.
This is a tropical zone. I don’t think I fully respected that until now. Hong Kong is its
own creature. If compared to New York, a similar metropolis, HK feels more alive,organic. More in harmony with the environment than attempting to be its master.
Perhaps this park is merely an oasis and I am being naive. People here is this city, thus
far, have been courteous as I had not expected. And as I pause to rest on a bench,
sheltered from the rain, I am blessed with the symphony of exotic bird calls.
This is a gift.
    </p>
<p>
    0900: Victoria Peak. I have to confess a certain disappointment. Not with the tram
that brought me up to this place, 45 degrees up the whole way, or with the peak itself,
but with the white out cloud conditions, which have no immediate remedy.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps I should try again later in the day. I am very tempted to do Disneyland
today, as much to get it out of the way as anything else. For breakfast I am at Pacific
Coffee, a chain coffee house. Had a chocolate croissant and a chicken and feta sandwich,
both warmed, and a small bottle of water. I don’t think I’m drinking nearly enough
water. HK$74, which comes out to around US$10 more or less. I’ve looked into local wifi
and met only frustration. I’m still hoarding my phone’s overseas data. Charging up my
phone while i chill, write, and wait for a hint of a view, and I plan my next move.
</p>

<p>
    1420: Hong Kong Disneyland. As a long time Disney fan well familiar with the
    original park, I have some thoughts. This park is well executed in what it has, but it has
    little. Some of the major anchor rides that draw me just are not here.
</p>

<p>
    No Star Wars or Indiana Jones. No Thunder Mountain or Haunted Mansion or
Pirates (though it looks as though they are working on at least some of these right now).
The only real E-ticket rides I’m seeing are Space Mountain and Jungle Cruise. The
island of the park is Tarzan’s Tree House, you take the raft over. And the water around
the island is circled by the Jungle Cruise ride. Different.
</p>

<p>
    As for food, being at Disney I looked for my frozen banana. No banana, but they
    did have popcorn, hotdogs, chicken skewers, and yes, everybody’s favorite, fish balls.
    Burgers and fries along side dim sum and noodles. I made the call that this was notwhere I wanted to sample Hong Kong cuisine and had some fried chicken. Saw a local
    eating his fries plain but covering his fried chicken in ketchup. Awesome.
</p>

<p>
    On the whole, the park is clean and well run, just small. Plus, rainy winter
weekday. Pretty quiet. No lines to speak of, so bonus.
Side note: drinking a bottle of Sprite, I was shocked by how differently, how better it
tasted. then I read the ingredients. No corn syrup. Actual sugar. Wow.
</p>
<p>
    2030: Back at Hostel. Left Disney around 1730 or so, got off the train in Kowloon,
across the water from Hong Kong, but still a part of Hong Kong. As Brooklyn is to
Manhattan, one might say.
</p>
<p>
    I walked from the station through a thriving commercial district to the ferry
terminal, taking the ferry over to Hong Kong. It’s a famous experience, and it owns
every bit if that fame. The Hong Kong skyline is marvelous, and unlike any other I’ve
seen, vibrant, colorful. On the whole, not a bad day.
