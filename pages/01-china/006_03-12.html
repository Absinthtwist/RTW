    <h1>Day Six</h1>
    <h2>Monday 12 March 2012</h2>
    <h3>Xi'an, China</h3>
    <p>
        Awoke around 0600 this morning, but stayed in bed until around 0800.
Had a pleasant breakfast and am now waiting as my clothes are in the
washing machine. A nice lady with very little English was kind enough to
help me figure the machine out. It’s hard to keep up with the charging up of
batteries through all of this. I knew it would be a challenge, and there are
certainly worse things. Having my iPhone with me is a huge help.
I have two things I need to do today, and one thing I’d like to do. Of the
things I need to do, one is laundry and that is happening right now. The
second thing is that train ticket. I paid for a train ticket online to be
delivered to my hostel, but no show. I will need to buy something today,
hopefully there is something available today, or tomorrow at the least. If
pressed, I can fly, but I was really hoping for the train. If push comes to
shove, I don’t need to be in Beijing until Thursday morning, though that
would really and truly suck.
    </p>
<p>
    As to the thing I don’t need to do but would really like to do, I would very
much like to investigate the wall that surrounds the old part of Xi’an. It’s
the only complete city wall in China, hundreds of years old, and is about 10
miles all the way around. It looked cool as hell as I passed in yesterday.
</p>
<p>
    Thankfully, the train ticket was delivered right as I was checking out of the
hostel. With that done, I walked straight to the city wall. It took a little
exploring before I could find an official entrance, but it was worth the
effort. 40 feet tall, 40 feet or wider at the top, 60 feet at the base, covering
an 8 mile square wall around the original city. The only intact city wall in China, and one of the oldest such walls in the
world. Not too bad. You can rent a bicycle and ride the loop, but time being
limited, I made my way to the train station.
</p>
<p>
    The Xi’an Railway Station was amazing. A crazy insane ant-hill meets
    feeding frenzy filled with more people that I would think possible. If course,
    all of that chaos was banished by my first class ticket as I was let into the
    nicer, more elite waiting room.
    I should mention that much to my surprise almost everyone I meet has at
    least some amount of English. I really did not expect that.
    As for the train itself, I shared a compartment with three other people. We
    each had a bunk, two upper and two lower. I read for a bit, then it was
    lights out for all as we each got some version of sleep as the train bumped
    and rattled on through the night for the 14 hour ride.
