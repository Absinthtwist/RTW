    <h1>Day 58: Politics</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 3 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Cairo, Egypt</h3>   
    <p>Not much to say about today. Yesterday, while I was out walking, nothing
        particular to be seen or heard, at least ten human lives were ended in
        conflict between police and protestors. It’s the sort of thing I was conscious
        of as I approached Egypt, not wanting to take stupid risks. Things seemed
        reasonable enough, and Luxor was just fine. No politics whatever from that
        quarter. The. This shit.</p>
    <p>To be honest, it does not make me scared, it makes me angry. I find it
        especially annoying as I saw no protests or rallies of any kind. Am I at risk
        for this nonsense every time I walk down the street? I accept a certain
        amount of risk, but not stupid risk. There’s a lot of amazing stuff to see in
        Cairo, and maybe I’ll look back with regret, but the call I’m making today is
        to just lay low. I’m gonna blow off most of my sight seeing in Cairo and justchill in my hotel rooms. Short of open armed conflict, I feel I really should
        go see the pyramids and the sphinx, and being so far removed from the
        center of town I’m not too concerned there. As for the rest of the sights of
        Cairo, it’s a shame but I’m writing them off one and all. Just gonna chill. It
        makes me angry. But it is what it is.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow, Friday, is the holy day here. I may do the pyramids tomorrow,
        or if that strikes out, then Saturday. Come Sunday, off to stable and
        peaceful Istanbul.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
