    <h1>Day 54: Valley Of The Kings</h1>
    <h2>Sunday 29 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Luxor, Egypt</h3>   
   <p>Awake by 0500 and out the door by 0600, a twenty- five minute drive, then
    the Valley of the Kings. Over sixty Pharaonic tombs under the earth, fromthousands of years ago. The ticket grants you entry to three tombs only, and
    two of the most famous are separate, Tutankhamen and Rameses VI. From
    what I’ve heard, tut’s tomb is not terribly impressive, all the good stuff from
    there is in Cairo, and the entrance fee is more than the entire Valley of the
    Kings site. Not as expensive but supposedly fantastic, I purchase a ticket for
    Rameses VI.</p>
    <p>The valley itself is hemmed in by the desert rock towering above on all
        sides. I wind my way through, past small brick walls and name plates
        leading down into the mountainside. The tombs themselves are similar
        enough to my amateur eyes to say that they were all amazing but, aside
        from subtle variations, were all basically alike. I wouldn’t call myself a
        complete idiot on Egyptian lore, and doubtless the connoisseur would
        cringe to hear me say as much, but I have not their trained eyes.</p>
    <p>You begin by stepping through a door into a long corridor, the walls richly
        decorated with full color classic Egyptian images. Pharaohs, Gods, images
        of life, all in color, etched deeply into the walls. This corridor, slowly
        descending for perhaps thirty yards, opens into a large chamber, again,
        beautifully decorated. This time, along with the walls, the ceiling is also
        beautifully painted, the body of Nut, the sky Goddess, stretches from one
        end of the room to the other, her body glittering with stars. Still
        descending, one last corridor, much shorter, leads into a final chamber,
        smaller than the previous, where the remnants of a great stone sarcophagus
        would stand, it’s rich contents long gone. No photography was allowed
        anywhere in the Kings Valley, and I lack the articulate skills to adequately
        describe the fantastic images upon the walls, the vivid colors still rich all
        these millennia later.</p>
    <p>From here I went to the tomb of Hatshepsut, the female Pharaoh. Unlike
        the other tombs, all underground with almost nothing without to mark
        them, Hatshepsut’s tomb door is adorned with a huge three story
        monument, very grand, culminating in that same quiet door leading down
        into the womb of the mountain. Grand staircases, columns, and rows of
        statues all adorn the monument to this most unique of Egyptian Pharaohs,
        the only woman to openly rule (that I know of). Ancient Egypt was a culture
        built on stability and maintaining the status quo, boat rockers were not well
        respected. So even as a woman, Hatshepsut upheld the Pharaonic
        traditions, including the goatee (not actually hers), with which she is nearly
        always depicted, even when distinctly feminine.</p>
    <p>By this point, the sun is getting high, and I return to the shelter of my
        “hotel” room to chill for a couple hours. I should take a moment to chat a
        bit about an important Egyptian topic: baksheesh. A nice interpretation for
        this might be a tip, less nice would be a bribe. It seems interwoven through
        all of Middle-Eastern culture, I saw some of it in Jordan, but it seems to
        have a new life here in Egypt. I confess my cultural bias sees baksheesh as
        ultimately a bad thing, but I am learning to make peace with it. One thing
        my travels have made me appreciate is the rule of law. Justice should be
        blind, rules equally applied. Americans voice complaint of local corruption,
        and rightly, but with no idea of how the rest of the works is so much worse.
        In my short time here, it’s clear that every law is flexible, and I don’t feel it
        should be. Less ethically disturbing but far more annoying is how most of
        the locals, hard up for cash, all want to help you and expect a little
        something for it. They will smile and point out a wall and want a tip for
        that. I think I would have noticed the wall in my own, thanks. In India I
        would be hounded by drivers wanting to take me or guides wanting to lead
        me, but always we would discuss a price and agree or not. Here they
        provide a service, unasked for, then want money for it. I confess it really
        bothered me at first, but now, making a little peace with it and rethinking
        my budget, I just know when to turn away from locals before they get
        started or just have a little cash on hand. Anyway, enough bitching.</p>
    <p>Come 1600, the heat mellowing a bit, I arrange for a felluca ride. This is a
        small sail boat, very traditional on the Nile. Alas, the wind was nonexistent,
        but it was still pleasant. We got a tug upriver and stopped for a walk
        through a small banana farm. That is to say it was a farm of small size
        growing bananas of small size, quite charming. We, my pilot and I, stop at a
        small restaurant and enjoy some fresh bananas while a couple of locals are
        glued to a large tv screen watching American wresting, in all it’s silliness,
        with the added absurdity of two professional sportscasters speaking
        passionately in arabic. I try not to let it kill the mood. We are on the west
        bank of the Nile, which is quiet and traditional. It’s common to see people
        farming or rolling down a dirt road on an ox drawn cart, a glimpse of time
        travel. The east bank of the river is the modern chaos of a city. Noise and
        cars and modern conveniences.</p>
    <p>After our bananas and wrestling, we return to our boat and to the windless
        flat calm water. The river current pushes us down-river, but only slowly. We
        unfurl the sail in desperate hope, but my pilot ends up rowing us back.While perhaps not as classical a sail boat ride as one might hope for, it was
        enjoyable all the same.</p>
    <p>I return back to camp and relax for the rest of the evening. Tomorrow, who
        knows. Perhaps Luxor temple. I could spend two weeks here and still find
        new sights, but within my limits I feel at peace with the tombs I have seen.
        The two temples, Luxor and Karnak, should appease me.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
