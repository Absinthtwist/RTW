    <h1>Day 60: The Great Pyramids</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 5 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Cairo, Egypt</h3>   
    <p>Nice to get out of my hotel room finally. Out the door by 0800, I walk to the
        metro station and ride to Giza. From there, it’s a bit of a trek, about eight
        kilometers or so, but after being cooped up so long, I’m ready for the walk.
        It’s an easy path, a straight line past store fronts and fast food vendors, and
        I stop more than once for water.</p>
    <p>I am wondering how much further when I am taken aback by the surprising
        sight of the top of one of the Great Pyramids suddenly protruding over the
        roof of an apartment complex. Quite an image. Further, I can tell I am close
        because I am suddenly being pestered by people trying to be my friend,
        wanting me to go another way, etc. A little further on and I get an even
        more bizarre sight: the Great Pyramids of Egypt, towering over a golf
        course. In the desert.</p>
    <p>Beating off vendors, I push my way into the pyramid complex. The first and
        most obvious thing is their colossal size. Immense. They have long ago been
        stripped of their smooth, polished casing, and the rough stepped exterior
        only hints at their original appearance. One of the pyramids still has a bit of
        these smooth stones at its peak, allowing me to imagine how even more
        impressive they were once upon a time.</p>
    <p>I circle round the pyramids, having made the decision not to go in to any of
        the pyramids today. It’s a tiny four foot high tunnel for a hundred meters of
        steep incline, and I am a tall man. And ultimately, I just don’t feel it. I don’t
        feel that I need to do that. Maybe another time. After being accosted a bit
        more by a man with a camel who insists on taking my picture then wants
        far far too much money for it, I move on to the Sphinx.</p>
    <p>I don’t really know what to say about the Sphinx. Or the Pyramids, really.
        These are some of the most photographed, most documented objects on the
        planet. Seeing them is nice, I’m glad I came, but there’s no wow. Karnak
        was breath taking. These aren’t breath taking. They are the same exact
        Pyramids and Sphinx I’ve seen on tv a thousand thousand times. The grand
        size is surely impressive, and the idea that bronze-age human effort,
        practically by hand, assembled all of this. But it feels like less of an amazing
        discovery and more like a recognition. Yep, that’s them.</p>
    <p>I take a taxi back to my hotel and chill for a bit. This is my last night here,
        but I’m still not ready to relax. Maybe I’m silly, but whatever. I take a walk
        and see the streets a bit, then return to my room. Tomorrow, an early start
        and on to stable and secure and safe Istanbul.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
