    <h1>Day 55: Luxor Temple</h1>
    <h2>Monday 30 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Luxor, Egypt</h3>   
    <p>Slept in a bit today, and took my time with breakfast, chatting casually with
        my fellow travelers. It appears we will all be departing on the same train, all
        bound for Cairo tomorrow night. All the same, even taking my time, I am
        out the door by 0830.</p>
    <p>Rather than a driver, I return to my area of greatest comfort: solo foot
        travel. It’s perhaps a kilometer at most to the ferry terminal. It is, of course,
        surrounded by many boats and locals, all of whom want to distract me from
        the vastly cheaper ferry. I ignore them and am across the Nile in minutes.
        Right off the ferry just across the street lies the beautiful Luxor Temple. I
        walk unhurriedly around the perimeter, enjoying the view while casually
        looking for an entrance. I find a staircase going up and I take it, only to
        discover a small but beautiful mosque, built within and upon the Egyptian
        Temple. As I prepare to politely back away, a man in traditional Arab-
        Egyptian dress comes forward and greets me. He introduces himself as the
        imam of this mosque and invites me in. I get over the baksheesh thing in
        my head and remember that experiences like this are exactly why I have
        come, a little baksheesh is worth it.</p>
    <p>He leads me in to the small mosque, which he tells me is eight hundred
        years old. The pharaonic columns of the Luxor Temple have been folded
        into the mosque, the ancient Egyptian art flowing beautifully into the
        Islamic. There is an area around the main building, covered with rugs,
        where a couple people are engaged in conversation, another two men are
        napping. The imam leads me into the main chamber, the prayer room,again with the pharaonic art mixing with Islam. I have a lovely if limited
        conversation with the imam where we agree on harmony and love between
        all peoples, and I slip him a generous tip and respectfully move on.</p>
    <p>The entrance to Luxor Temple is just a short way further, and I enter the
        grounds. To the right is what looks to have once been the grand entryway, a
        hundred yard path of stones lined on both sides by rows of sphinxes. To the
        left, aligned with the sphinx path, is the impressive entrance to the temple
        proper.</p>
    <p>It’s a large complex as these things go, about the size of a large cathedral. In
        my head I remind myself that Karnak Temple, which I shall see tomorrow,
        is at least three times larger. Two great statues sit in symmetrical placement
        of the doorway, with one towering obelisk to the left of the door. It is safe to
        assume that once upon a time a second obelisk stood in balance, but it is
        long gone. A quick check on wikipedia tells me that the missing obelisk is,
        in fact, the centerpiece of the Place de la Concorde in Paris. Guess they had
        to get it from somewhere.</p>
    <p>On the walls throughout all the temple are the classical images of
        hieroglyphs, cartouches, and the fabulous figures of Pharaohs, gods, and
        mortal men and women about their lives. Great tremendous columns in
        rows rise up to support nothing but themselves. I cannot say what they
        once supported, the distance between many of them seeming far too great
        to support anything from that era. I can see, perhaps twenty or more feet
        above the floor of the temple, the mosque I do recently explored. And
        further down in the temple I find columns and an archway that I would bet
        by backpack on were not from the Ancient Egyptian Pharaonic period. And
        the plaster, still visible on the upper portions of the tall walls, spread over
        and concealing the ancient carved reliefs, still bears hints of fresco images
        from a far later period, looking distinctly Roman or possibly even Christian
        to my eyes.</p>
    <p>After Luxor Temple, everything else is just a lite, so I go for a walk. I explore
        the streets of the city, walking through a souk or market, I pass through
        stalls of cheap Egyptian knock-offs and tee shirts, past great long rows of
        fresh fruits and vegetables, all looking a bit weak in my eyes. The vegetables
        in China were amazing, these all look a bit sad. I pass a shoe shine, seated
        at the curb, waiting for his next customer, passing the time sucking on a
        hookah. a great large fabulous looking building under construction, amosque or other religious structure, the two towers beside the great dome
        looking far more Coptic than Islamic to me.</p>
    <p>After drifting through the streets and hot sun (and a stop for a cool drink), I
        make my way to the Mummification Museum. Small and specialized, very
        well done. I enjoyed this museum very much, and was done all too soon.
        Upon returning to the street, I see the wind is now in full force, with dust
        filling the air. I take the ferry back and return to my room to hide from the
        heat and relax for the rest of the day. Tomorrow I shall see Karnak Temple,
        and in the evening depart for Cairo. I’d say I feel ready to leave Luxor and
        move on.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
