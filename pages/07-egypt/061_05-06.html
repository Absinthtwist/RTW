    <h1>Day 61: Istanbul!</h1>
    <h2>Sunday 6 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Cairo, Egypt to Istanbul, Turkey</h3>   
    <p>Awake by 0600 and out the door by 0630, in a taxi to the airport. At this
        point, Egypt and I are not having a good relationship, so all the little things
        I would blow off somewhere else are annoying me. India wore me out,
        Jordan was great but not long enough, then headlong into Egypt. Too much
        too fast. I would like to try Egypt again, in non-revolutionary conditions.The flight out is uneventful, and I am out of the airport and onto the streets
        of Istanbul by 1430 local time. I take the metro from the airport into town
        and it drops me about two or three kilometers from my hostel. There is a
        very reasonable looking tram, but I choose to walk.</p>
    <p>I must say the difference between Egypt and Turkey is huge. The weather,
        obviously, it’s a beautiful 75 Fahrenheit here. And green. But it’s more than
        these natural factors. Traffic laws are followed. People are relaxed, friendly.
        Things feel more western. I am on the edge of Europe, and it is apparent.
        This place looks and feels both European and Islamic. I must say, I
        immediately am in love. It takes no time at all to see that this is another city
        to add to the list of places I could live in for a year. Feels like its been a long
        time since I’ve touched that list. Istanbul makes me happy.</p>
    <p>The walk, through cobble stone streets, is very pleasant, if a bit of an
        incline. The sound of seagulls and peeks through the old five story buildings
        of the Mediterranean Sea all make my heart light. And when I stop to relax
        on a park bench, I turn casually to see the Blue Mosque, absolutely
        beautiful, in the not too far distance. There is so much gorgeous history to
        see here, and much of it seems packed in a conveniently small area.</p>
    <p>I walk just a short bit further and find my hostel, with a truly stunning
        reach-out-and-touch-it view of the Hagia Sophia from the door. I am taken
        aback by the behavior of the man at the desk, when I suddenly realize the
        noises he is making are friendliness. I have to shift out of the harsh,
        protective shell Egypt gave me and I chat with the desk clerk with giddy
        relief. He’s not after my cash, he’s just nice. I’m shown to my six bed dorm
        room, top corner bunk, and luxuriate in a well needed shower. You would
        think all that down time in Cairo would leave me clean and well rested.
        You’d be wrong. I almost cry when the hot shower with strong pressure
        washes me clean. Refreshed but still tired, I head out.</p>
    <p>My plan is to see the sights, including Hagia Sophia tomorrow, but my feet
        find their own current and I soon find myself outside the immense
        cathedral cum mosque. Just down the road, even more beautiful from the
        outside, is the Blue Mosque. Just by looking from the outside, Blue Mosque
        wins hands down.</p>
    <p>Knowing my Plan to explore Hagia Sophia tomorrow, I wander a bit and
        find more beautiful park-side, green and filled with people, sitting in the
        grass enjoying themselves, some looking out to the Mediterranean. I relax
        and take it all in.</p>
    <p>At some point I realize that I have two full hours before the Hagia Sophia
        closes, so I say screw it and just go. I buy my ticket, pass security, and step
        inside.</p>
    <p>Words fail.</p>
    <p>I’m not certain how best to articulate this. Clearly, not a building made to
        be most impressive from the outside, but truly and literally breath-taking
        from within. Awe inspiring. I feel physical chills and my throat tightens as I
        walk through the vast and unspeakably beautiful space. The dome is far far
        above, cavernous. Rows and rows of chandeliers hang down from above,
        low to where I can touch them if I choose: they merely serve to make the
        open space seem even greater. Fifteen centuries old, created in the death
        rattle of the Roman Empire as it shifted east to become the Byzantine
        Empire. The greatest Christian sacred space for a thousand years, how must
        it have messed with the Christian mind when this city and this cathedral
        were lost? How must it have messed with the Muslim mind when they
        stepped into this and made it their own? Bits of Byzantine mosaic remain,
        exquisite beauty, hinting of what it must have once been like. I walk
        through as the sun descends, watching as the light changes, but as the clock
        moves on, I am forced to tear myself away. However beautiful the Blue
        Mosque may be from the outside, competing with the interior of the Hagia
        Sophia is a tall order.</p>
    <p>I stop at a nice looking place for a bite to eat. Expensive, and merely
        adequate, but I can see the food potentials here are mind blowing. I am
        excitedly looking forward to being hungry again soon. Worn out from the
        flight and from the fun of Cairo, I return to my hostel. I make a new friend,
        a fabulous fellow traveler from Germany, we talk for a good while, and I
        decide to call it an early night, though I can see that tomorrow likely won’t
        be.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
    <p>PS- none of these pics do justice. I don’t see how any pic ever could.</p>
