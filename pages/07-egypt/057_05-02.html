    <h1>Day 57: Cairo</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 2 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Cairo, Egypt</h3>   
    <p>I get a wake up call around 0630, but I’m more or less already awake. The
        train is still bumping and rumbling along. I’d love to ask an expert, what is
        it about this train that’s so rocky? Are we going faster? Is it the way the
        track is lain? Or is it the train car itself? No answer forthcoming, I am up
        and ready for the day. No shower, naturally, but I am at least able to brush
        my teeth and comb back my hair. I just finish my hoarded orange when a
        breakfast tray comes, with another roll, a tough looking croissant, some
        butter and honey. I do what I can with it and watch the greens and yellows
        and browns of the landscape intermix, more and more frequently broken by
        increasingly larger villages then towns. We’re getting close to Cairo.</p>
    <p>The train pulls in just before 0900 and I make the short walk from the train
        station to the metro station. The metro system seems quite straight
        forward, and I ride to the center of downtown, not very far from my hostel,
        perhaps a kilometer. I pass the now famous Tahrir Square and see nothing
        more exciting than a few flags and banners. I also pass the Egyptian
        Museum.</p>
    <p>The traffic is some of the worst I’ve ever seen. Few traffic lights, and those
        they have are all but ignored. Crossing the street is always an adventure.
        Either you wait for gridlock and slip through, or you look for locals trying to
        cross and stick with them as they force their way across.</p>
    <p>The hostel is on the third floor of an old and worn building. An ancient
        looking elevator was long ago inserted in the gap of the staircase. It is still
        functional and I see people using it, but I’d just as soon take the well worn
        but very stable staircase. It’s a very serviceable hostel, though guesthouse
        seems a better description. Knowing I would be tired from roughing it, I
        wisely booked a private room with en suite bathroom back when I planned
        this out months ago. I am glad of my foresight. It’s a cosy room with AC and
        a shower, and a window facing out over rubble and dilapidation. I’ve seen
        this many times: build new, and there’s plenty of new construction, but
        ignore the bombed out remnants of crumbling buildings.</p>
    <p>I rest for a wee bit, then make the walk to the Egyptian Museum. Alas, no
        cameras. The museum is packed with Egyptian relics, many of them
        outshining the pieces I’ve seen in New York and London. Many mummy
        cases. A fantastic section on the Greco-Roman period (reminder: Cleopatra
        was not, strictly speaking, Egyptian). Some fantastic colossal statuary. And
        my two favorite gems of the museum: the Tutankhamen exhibit, including
        the most famous funerary mask of all time, and the Amarna room. If you
        aren’t familiar with the Amarna saga in Egyptian history, it’s really worth a
        look. A fantastic and mysterious – and brief – break in Egypt’s history of
        thousands of years of consistency and tradition. The reign of one pharaoh,
        later called the heretic king, who changed the religion, changed all the
        artistic style, moved the capitol far away, and all around pissed off the
        establishment. Nearly all of his history was erased from the records after he
        died, all his changes undone. We know little of him, or of his beautiful and
        now very famous wife Nefertiti. It all sounds like quite a story to me, still
        surprised no one ‘s made a movie of it all. Oh, one more thing: the heir whobecame pharaoh after him, his nephew, who undid all those dramatic
        changes, was quite young. I can only imagine he was pressured by the
        ruling elite to get things back to normal. That nephew ended up dying
        young too, some might say of dubious cause. His name was Tutankhamen.
        Too cool.</p>
    <p>After the Museum I take a walk through downtown, at first following the
        bank of the Nile, then steering back toward my hostel. Yes, I did see areas
        with a strong military presence, yes I saw police in riot gear, yes I saw
        armored vehicles with mounted machine guns. But they were all localized
        around one zone, and as no one else seemed concerned, I kept to myself
        and walked on.</p>
    <p>Still worn out from the train ride, my last such train ride on this journey I
        think, and still absorbing all of Cairo and its many facets, I call it an early
        evening and get some air conditioned rest. Not sure about tomorrow, a
        couple of choices. Pyramids and sphinx are one option, old medieval Cairo
        is another. I’ll figure it out in the morning. Probably the medieval stuff, if
        only so I can sleep in a bit. I should wake early for the pyramids.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
