    <h1>Day 56: Karnak Temple</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 1 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Luxor, Egypt</h3>   
    <p>Lazy morning again, had trouble sleeping in the dusty unrelenting heat.
        And of course there are the bugs. My insect repellant spilled on a flight and
        I never thought to replace it. Now my arms read like brail. Anyway, out the
        door before 0900 and ferried across the Nile. A two or three kilometer walk
        up-river to Karnak Temple.</p>
    <p>Yesterday I saw Luxor Temple, which was amazing. After Karnak, however,
        Luxor Temple is best described as “cute.” Karnak is amazing. And huge.
        Supposedly the largest ancient religious site in the world, and only perhaps
        a third is open to the public. Many obelisks, including a fallen one, lying
        horizontal. A vast hall of towering Herculean columns, spread out like a
        forest, supporting no visible roof, profoundly impressive. Every square inch
        of wall is packed with great pictographs and hieroglyphs. In some areas,
        one can see bits of faded color, a glimpse of what this entire place must
        have looked thousands of years ago, splashed with vivid hues. As I walk
        between the towering columns, all I can think is that this place was ancient
        beyond words when Julius Caesar walked here with Cleopatra. And still,
        here it stands.</p>
    <p>After Karnak I stop for a bite to eat and make my way back to camp. I relax
        and chat with my fellow travelers for a bit, step out for a lite dinner on the
        river bank, and generally try to relax, avoid the heat and the bugs.</p>
    <p>Around 2130 my four British friends and fellow travelers, all set to ride the
        same train. We take a boat across the water, and make our way around
        Luxor Temple one last time, then up the road to the station. The train
        station looks new and quite nice, and when the train comes it seems quite
        pleasant. I say farewell to my companions and make my way to my train
        car.</p>
    <p>Unlike India where compartments were separated by curtain, this is more
        like China. Each compartment has a door, and inside there are two bunks,
        top and bottom. I take the top bunk for security, though as it turns out I
        have this compartment to myself. The bed is a bit short for me but
        adequately comfortable. I am prepared to settle in for the night when, to my
        surprise, I am brought a chicken dinner. I do what I can with that, saving a
        roll and an orange for breakfast, then try to get some sleep. This is by far
        the bumpiest of all the trains I’ve been on, but I think I manage to doze off a
        little. To be continued.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
