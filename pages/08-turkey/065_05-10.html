    <h1>Day 65: Istanbul To Athens</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 10 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Istanbul, Turkey to Athens, Greece</h3>   
   <p>I spend a relaxed morning slowly picking at my breakfast while talking with
    my fellow travelers. I haven’t seen too many Americans on the backpacking
    scene, but plenty of Canadians and Australians. Always a pleasure.</p>
    <p>My remaining time in Istanbul is limited, and that always hangs over me. I
        hate to start anything if I’m constantly going to be looking at my watch. I
        find myself wandering through the streets, the weather a bit chilly, the sky
        an overcast grey. I end up back at the Grand Bazaar, where I wander
        unhurriedly. The Turkish lamps, multi-faceted glass bowls dangling from
        chains, are quite lovely. I’d love to buy one, but that’s about as impractical
        an idea as I can imagine. No doubt such lamps can be picked up in the
        States without too much trouble. I’m hoping that’s something I can say
        about most of the tempting buys from here on out: easily picked up back
        home when I have more money. My daily expenses will be increasing, I can
        tell, and I would like to spend that money on good food and experience. I
        don’t regret my purchases, but western Europe should be a different
        animal. I hope. My fellow travelers all agree with me that Istanbul us
        wonderful but too expensive. I am relieved to hear that the rest of Turkey
        has much more reasonable prices, then I remember my itinerary; not places
        likely to be cheap in the least. Oh well.</p>
    <p>My bag now weighs 9.3kg. When America talks about airports in others
        countries having poor security, I have no idea what they are talking about.
        Security to get into the airport. Then again at the gate. And another thing:
        this whole business about airlines being too strapped for cash to offer meals
        anymore, that’s total fantasy. Once I left North America, I got fed on everyflight. This flight to Athens, less than an hour in the air and I got a pretty
        reasonable chicken sandwich.</p>
        <h3>1800</h3>
    <p>Off the plane and on the metro into Athens. The train is one of the
        priciest of this sort I’ve seen, but Greece is rather famously out of pocket
        change. The weather is gorgeous, the landscape fantastic, and the color of
        the water coming in truly took my breath away. I confess the idea of being
        here, in Greece, leaves me with a big grin on my face.</p>
    <p>My directions say to get of of this train and take a different train for one
        stop. That seems silly to me, and the one kilometer walk sounds like a good
        introduction, so I walk out onto the street. In Istanbul, you felt the
        centuries of history in every block. In every step. Athens… Athens could be
        a new city. Maybe not shiny new, but it certainly doesn’t show it’s age.
        Walking these streets, I think: this could be Los Angeles, but with the
        occasional ancient ruin. I walk past the beautiful remains of some unknown
        temple, mere feet from busy traffic.</p>
    <p>My hostel is the classic high-function hostel. Efficient. I’m on the third
        floor, and I grab a lower bunk, possibly at the expense of a priceless
        electrical outlet, but I’ll cross that bridge later. My very first act upon arrival
        is to gather my things, exit the hostel, walk past the waiting Acropolis to the
        nearby laundromat. I’ve been hand-washing since Bangkok, and I see that
        it’s a stopgap measure at best. My clothes feel oily. Ugh. Note to self: find
        out how to hand-wash clothes correctly.</p>
    <p>Never ask me how much I paid for this laundry! As long as you live, never
        ask me! Enough to know a sacrifice was paid, I must shield you from this
        horror!</p>
    <p>After laundry, I settled down for a very pleasant Greek salad before turning
        in.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow: Acropolis.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
