    <h1>Day 63: Why Constantinople Got The Works…</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 8 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Istanbul, Turkey</h3>   
   <p>Took my time getting up, and enjoyed a simple breakfast. Out the door by
    0930. I take my time wandering around, and make a stop to mail off the ton
    of stuff I’ve been lugging around in my pack, some of it from India. It’s a
    relief to see it go. I’m thinking as I head into modern Internet connected
    western Europe, there will be fewer things I feel I gotta buy there. Many
    nice things, no doubt, but easier to acquire from home if I really want it.
    I’ve spent a ton of money buying things. Next time I do a trip like this, I will
    budget accordingly.</p>
    <p>In no particular hurry, and not exactly the most direct route, I make for a
        Byzantine site called Chora Church. I can already see that my mission here
        in Istanbul has changed. I’m not here to see sights, I’m here to absorb and
        become familiar with the city. Because it has become all too clear, I must
        return to Turkey. This place is too amazing.</p>
    <p>Walking through the streets, past high end candy shops and people by the
        dozens with soft serve ice cream, I’m left wondering if Istanbul has even
        more of a sweet tooth than America. And I’ve seem very little obesity, so
        whatever they’re doing seems to work. Walking all these hills I suppose.</p>
    <p>I arrive at Chora Church, which is really quite small, more of a chapel. It’s
        design is distinctly Byzantine: a deliberately asymmetrical hodge-podge of
        different sized barrels and flat walls, with the occasional flying buttress
        thrown in. Not terribly impressive from the outside. But the inside is
        fantastic. The floors are marble of contrasting colors, the walls, alive with
        frescoes and mosaics, the arched and vaulted ceilings even more so. It
        seems strange to see this much art, this much wealth and energy, focused
        on this small church well outside the city at the time. While a good portion
        of the imagery is devoted to Christ, he shares equal space with the VirginMary, her own sacred birth (from the Apocrypha) depicted in detail. It’s
        quite a beautiful site.</p>
    <p>Up to my old tricks, I pick a direction and start going, not sure how I’ll end
        up home, just confident that I shall. I see some fantastic views before
        making my way to the water again. I have a lovely walk along the bank,
        stopping in green parks along the way. Another thing to remark about
        Istanbul is the cats. Lots and lots of outdoor cats. Healthy looking, cared
        for, but wandering freely.</p>
    <p>I make my way to the great Spice Market. I grab a quick bite to eat and
        wander. It’s quite touristy, lots of sweets. A few camera ready bids of
        powdered spices. It’s amusing, but not worth spending forever in. I return
        to my hostel and do what I’ve been putting off: hand laundry. There’s a
        washing machine in Athens, I already checked. I have every intention of
        just being lazy and watching my laundry dry for the rest of the night.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
    <p>ps- ok, I guess I was wrong. I did go out and I had a lovely time. But
        needless to say, not every single thing I do ends up posted on this website.
        Ciao!</p>
