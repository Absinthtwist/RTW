    <h1>Day 64:Is Nobody’s Business But The Turks</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 9 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Istanbul, Turkey</h3>   
   <p>Breakfasted and out the door by 0900, I make for my priority for today: the
    Istanbul Archaeological Museum. I have read that it is quite good, and am
    excited to see how it holds up.</p>
    <p>The museum, first established in the mid 1800s as the world at large was
        becoming interested in such things, is, in fact, phenomenal. I was prepared
        for the sort of museum I had experienced in India and Thailand: an old,
        poorly presented and uninteresting gallery of ancient lore. What I found
        instead was modern, compelling, and vast. Too much so: I had to throw in
        the towel, my mind going soft after around three hours.</p>
    <p>I’ve encountered this before. When I was in New York, I discovered that I
        could soak up the Met for about two hours before everything turned to
        wallpaper. I was prepared for this in Paris, with museum after gallery after
        museum, but I have been caught off-guard here. Oops. It is important to
        stress that for all intents and purposes, Turkey is ancient Greece. The
        cultures interacted near constantly. The famous city of Troy, brought to life
        in the epic tales of Homer, is right here in Turkey. And this is Rome too. In
        the west we are taught that the Roman Empire was over by the end of the
        fifth century. Total crap: they just moved their headquarters. To here. Yes,
        they also changed their religion and official language (to Greek), but the
        culture, the customs, the laws, all Roman. They called themselves Roman.
        The title of “Byzantine” came later, a creation of historians. And then there
        are the Ottomans, one of the longest running imperial lines in history. A
        realm we know, if only in pop culture passing, of harems and scimitars, and
        of rich sultans. I confess I know all too little. The museum is full, and
        expresses all of this. By brain is broken.</p>
    <p>Really, this is a great time for a sidebar about how this is the absolutely
        perfect time for me to do this trip. The education I gain from this trip
        makes the next such trip all the more expensive. If I knew then what I know
        now, I might have tried to save more money, and perhaps put the trip off
        indefinitely. And what fun is that. I have learned that I don’t need five star
        hotels, but a level or two up from how I am traveling now, I think, would be
        best. My bed is too small for me, and the terrace bar above me likes to play
        music rather loudly. I find that I am feeling wiped out around midday and I
        must confess, I’m not getting quality sleep. Mind you, some hostels can be
        great, but I think a private room would be appropriate. And as I am now
        entering Europe, I am wondering if my daily budget will be adequate. I
        mean, sure, absolutely, I will be fine. But I may need to cut back.</p>
    <p>Today I was hoping to hit that Turkish bath, but when I saw the prices, I
        was insulted. Absolutely out of the question do-you-think-I’m-an-idiot
        prices. But of course, I’m in touristville, gringolandia, with dollar bill signs
        on my forehead. They are so much nicer than in Egypt, I’m not complaining
        as such, but it is a part of the reality. If I were willing to cross the water and
        get out of gringolandia I could find a bath for a fraction of the price. But as
        the sun is now going down and I am leaving tomorrow, I must confess,
        having had a nice Turkish bath experience elsewhere (at a sane price), it’s
        not a deal-breaker.</p>
    <p>The only other things I was hoping to see on this trip was the Mosaic
        Museum, which was closed (but I feel well represented on the mosaic issue
        with Chora Church), and the Mosque of Süleymaniye the Great (but I’m
        feeling well represented by the Blue Mosque). These and many other things
        would be great to see, but something is always left undone. Motivation to
        come back.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
