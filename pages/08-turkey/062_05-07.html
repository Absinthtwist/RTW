    <h1>Day 62: Was Once Constantinople</h1>
    <h2>Monday 7 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Istanbul, Turkey</h3>   
   <p>Free breakfast in my hostel starts at 0830. I hold out as long as I can, but
    by 0800 I give up and hit the streets. Gorgeous and empty. I head to the
    plaza space between the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque, taking in the
    space, then head to the Blue Mosque. Astounding from without, greater
    even that the Hagia Sophia, I am curious to see how the interior compares.
    It seems a bit unfair, but they did make the Blue Mosque in a deliberate
    effort to outdo. Let’s see how that went.</p>
    <p>I remove my shoes and enter, joined by a handful of early risers. Every inch
        of the interior of the Blue Mosque is an exercise in elegance and beauty.
        The far walls ablaze with beautiful stained glass, which I did not expect. A
        stunning, graceful dome extends far above, and four massive pillars mark
        the corners below that extend up to it. This is truly beautiful, truly amazing.
        If this were anywhere else, not half a kilometer from the Hagia Sophia…
        The Blue Mosque is wonderful, but if I must compare, and how can I not,
        then it must take a very respectful second place.</p>
    <p>I step outside and walk over to a rather unimpressive structure, the
        entrance to the Basilica Cistern of Istanbul. When the Byzantines (read:
        Eastern Roman Empire) were building Constantinople (read: Istanbul)
        (tons of history here), they built several underground water containers
        (read: cisterns) to serve to large population. This is the finest one left,
        though obviously not still in service. I take a staircase down below the level
        of the street, into a dark damp wonder. The light is kept deliberately low,
        the floor walkway, added recently, is damp from water occasionally
        dripping from above. Rows of classical Roman columns, recycled from
        temples and other buildings long forgotten, hold up the ceiling of vaulted
        brick. The water, which no doubt once filled this entire vast chamber, is
        now no more than a foot deep, with large goldfish swimming through it.
        The darkness and silence, emphasized by the rare echo, and the wet
        columns and the drip of water, all make this an amazing experience.</p>
    <p>From here I make my way to Topkapi Palace. I tend to be less interested in
        the lifestyles of the rich and spoiled, but here I am, and I admit it’s quitelovely. This is the spot from which the Ottoman Empire was commanded
        for centuries, if I understand correctly. Especially popular is the site of the
        old harem. Yes, this is the source of all of that lore. It is interesting, but I
        can’t quite help feeling a bit … I don’t know. History is full of things that
        worked then but that we would reject today. It’s not that it happened, it’s
        that people continue to grin and romanticize what can best be described as
        slavery and institutionalized rape. But maybe I’m just wrong headed about
        the whole thing.</p>
    <p>After the palace, I’m quite hungry, so I stop for some local chow, then make
        the short trek to the great bazaar. This is the largest covered souk in the
        world, or so I am told. It certainly is very large and labyrinthine, and it’s
        entertaining to cruise through for a bit, but as I won’t be buying anything, I
        can’t bring myself to stay long.</p>
    <p>I walk back to the hostel to unwind a bit, then start walking again, this time
        for the water. Departing from the area I’ve been spending all my time, I
        discover that I love Istanbul even more. It’s rolling hills and waterfront
        make it hard for me to not think of San Francisco. But, you know, with the
        Byzantine and Ottoman empires. And now a republic.</p>
    <p>The bridge crossing the Golden Horn waters has two levels. The upper level
        with the cars, and a lower level, quite close to the waters and removed from
        the noise of traffic, filled with lovely open air restaurants, not surprisingly
        specializing in sea food. I walk past as customers finish their meals, sip
        unhurriedly on apple tea, smoking on water pipes, playing backgammon.</p>
    <p>Reaching the other side (no, this is still Europe. There's another bridge to
        cross to enter Asia), I find more hills and more fantastic. A lovely tower
        stands atop the hill, but the crowd waiting to enter negate my temptation. I
        find a wonderful shopping district, very few tourists, and I just walk and
        absorb. I pass several musical street performers with a smile on my face
        before I hear a music that makes me stop. A crowd has gathered around
        three musicians, including a woman with one of the most haunting and
        mesmerizing voices I have ever heard. Listening to her, even there on that
        crowded street, nearly brings me to tears. I buy a cd and make a note of
        their website (I dare say travel has changed a wee bit), then move on. I
        decide to luxuriate a bit and I go see a movie, the Avengers. 3d continues to
        seem a waste in my eyes, and Jos Whedon remains wonderful.</p>
    <p>The walk back, if it’s even possible, seems even more charming with the sun
        gone and lights upon the water. I make it back to my hostel and join my
        fellow travelers before retiring for the evening.</p>
 <p>Safe journey.</p>
