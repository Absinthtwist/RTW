    <h1>Day 69: Hiking In Flip-Flops</h1>
    <h2>Monday 14 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Santorini, Greece</h3>   
   
    <p>Today, my plans are loose, I just know I need to catch a boat by 1530 at the
        latest. And I figure I’ll go down to Akrotiri, to see the excavation site, maybe
        some of the beaches. Seeing how this is a nice, laid back island, I retire my
        watch, set my shoes aside in favor of flip-flops, and wear shorts.</p>
    <p>I am out the door by 0845 and walk over to what is loosely called the bus
        station. The bus to Akrotiri doesn’t leave till 1000, which is a bit frustrating,
        but what can you do. I loiter around town, people watch, and make a visit to
        the grocery store before returning to the bus station.</p>
    <p>We pass through a small town, likely Akrotiri, and stop at a beach at the
        terminus of the road. A brief walk takes me to the gate of the excavation
        and reveals that it is closed on Monday. That done, I proceed to the beach,
        which has crystal clear waters and black sand, though far more rocks and
        pebbles than sand. It is quite lovely, though the water is far too cold for my
        taste.</p>
    <p>I walk a bit further up the hill and find an overview of a beach of dark, brick
        red sand. I have a time of it climbing down, too obtuse to notice the easier
        path, I hike my own way through water and over rocks and boulders. Fun
        but not speedy, or without blood. The red beach is quite lovely and more
        sandy, but the water is far too cold for me. I go in, but soon feel like its
        some macho game, not a joy, so I get out. I see my feet, caked in fine red
        sand: I look like I’ve been walking in chili powder.</p>   
    <p>I figure I have enough time for lunch and decide on a splurge. I am on an
        island, I should have some fresh seafood. After consulting with the staff, I
        pick out my fresh catch, don’t ask me what it was. A fish. She didn’t know
        the English name, and I surely didn’t. I start with a Greek salad, which
        contains no lettuce whatever, but is delicious all the same, despite my
        preconceptions. The fish takes a bit, but comes out nicely grilled and intact.
        Head, skin, etc. I get to work. The skin I remove, and I am careful to remove
        bones, but otherwise, I pick it good and clean. It takes me a while to get my
        check, and as I am waiting for my change, I can, from where i stand, see my
        bus depart.</p>
    <p>This puts me in a bit of a spot. I was planning on stopping by the hostel and
        picking up some stuff, taking my time. That door is now closed. I chill,
        waiting the ninety minutes for the next bus, soaking up the sun. The busfinally comes, and as it drops me off, I start running. If I am going to catch
        my boat, it’s going to be close.</p>
    <p>The boat is a simple affair, and there are perhaps two dozen of us at most
        aboard. The first journey is brief, to the volcano island. I have managed to
        catch my breath, but my feet feel a bit raw from all the running and hiking
        in such poorly chosen footwear. Flip-flops are not meant for this. And now,
        as I step on the the volcano island, I see I have more hiking to do, through
        loose rocks and dark volcanic gravel, up steep hills. It’s an interesting
        environment, the sort of thing that reminds me of Mars.</p>
    <p>We get back to the boat and we make our way to the location of the hot
        springs, which we have to swim to. Here’s the loss from my missed bus: no
        change of clothes, no towel. The breeze is already getting chilly, and
        evening is coming, and I have no illusions about that water temperature,
        hot spring or no. So alas, I give the hot springs and swim a pass.</p>  
    <p>From here we cruise slowly for the next couple hours as the sun gets lower
        and the breeze gets cooler, and I do not regret my choice to skip the swim.
        The clouds block the best parts of the sunset, but it is still quite lovely. With
        that, we head back to our port.</p>
    <p>I cable car back up along with my fellow passengers and make a quick stop
        for a gyro dinner, then return to my hostel, where I spend a good couple of
        hours chatting about travel and politics and life with my bunk mate. My
        legs ate pretty sore, and a bit burned. The skin between my first and second
        toes on both feet, where the flip-flop sandal rubs, is quite raw. Tomorrow:
        real shoes.</p>
    <p>Also tomorrow: the local museum, the excavation site if I can, and the ferry
        at 1700ish to Heraklion.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
