    <h1>Day 71: Nap Time</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 16 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Heraklion, Greece</h3>   
   
    <p>Today is an utterly lazy day, so I suppose not so good for you, my dear
        reader, but I enjoyed it just fine. I woke up like a gunshot at 0600 and
        remembered where I am and my plan for day and went right back to sleep. I
        woke again somewhere around 1000 and took my sweet time getting ready.</p>
    <p>By 1100 I am up and on the street. The walk to the Archaeological Museum
        is short, a kilometer and a half, and makes for a nice stretch of the legs. The
        museum itself is no larger than the museum in Santorini, and I had trouble
        stretching it out to thirty minutes. But even so, small as it is, some of the
        pieces in there are world class. This is stuff I very specifically remember
        from my art history studies, and it’s quite a treat to see.</p>
    <p>Once done with that, I wander aimlessly through the shopping district,
        people watching and scenery soaking. I am at this for perhaps an hour
        before I amble back to my hotel room for a nap. It’s a truly blissful, guilt
        free nap, but by 1800 I’m getting a bit hungry, so wander out and find some
        grub. I’m half tempted by the sight of a bowling alley, walk around the port
        area a bit, then back to my thoroughly adequate bed.</p>
    <p>Really a lazy day. And my apologies, but I’m not sure that tomorrow will be
        any better reading for you. I’m looking forward to it. I can’t sit still forever,
        it drives me nuts, but sometimes you just gotta fill up the sleep tank.</p>   
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
