    <h1>Day 68: Athens To Santorini</h1>
    <h2>Sunday 13 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Athens to Santorini, Greece</h3>   
   
    <p>Up and out the door by 0830, waiting for the metro to take me to the
        airport by 0900. The Greek people are warm and sociable, very enjoyable to
        interact with. They seem pretty laid back and always welcoming. Some of
        the women are gorgeous, while others seem awkward. Too much make up,
        garish colors, bad hair coloring. I’m no fashionista, but it seems peculiar.</p>
    <p>The plane ride is brief and unremarkable, and I catch a bus from the airport
        to the town of Thira. The island of Santorini is just large enough where
        walking it is a wee bit too much. There are fewer cars here, and tourists
        seem to rent four-wheelers to get around. I quest for my hostel, and it’s a
        bit of an adventure. While there are a couple main roads, there are also
        many winding labyrinthine paved footpaths, and none of the buildings
        seem to have addresses. I know the general location, and am in good spirits
        and no particular hurry, and eventually I find the place. The guy at the
        counter is, of course, very friendly and happy to talk. He is originally from
        Crete, but is quite proud of the beauty of Santorini. After I drop of my bags
        and shower, he sits me down with a map of the island making notes and
        circling places. He tells me if I get through those, to come back, he’ll circle
        some more.</p>
    <p>Newly armed with my map, I set out, unsure of what I mean to do with my
        afternoon. I start by securing a ticket for my ferry to Heraklion, that was a
        loose end that had been bothering me. I grab a gyro, delicious, low price,
        simple, walk-able, and I walk toward the heart of the town. The town is
        quite touristy, but all too beautiful notwithstanding. Many shops and
        restaurants would be happy to have my business, and I browse here and
        there, but am soon moving again. To the east, where my hostel is, you can
        see the landscape gradually sloping down, the sea in the distance. But here,
        on the west side of the island, it’s quite different. The hill has risen up to a
        cliff side, now covered by the village, and below is a great bay. Once long
        ago, the island of Santorini was circular in shape. But around 1500 BC, a
        volcano erupted and blasted the island into a giant “C” shape. And in themiddle of this bay sits an island: the volcano. Hot springs still bubble in
        parts of the waters of that bay. The less fabulous and more scientific
        thoughts about the legend of Atlantis often point right to this island. There
        are excavations of a thriving culture that was destroyed by that volcanic
        eruption. Destroyed, and preserved. I hope tomorrow or Tuesday to have a
        good look at what they’ve uncovered.</p>
    <p>Floating in the bay I see no less than five cruise ships. Below the cliffs, at
        the waters edge is a dock with several buildings. There is a cable-car taking
        people down, but the line is significant. There are many donkeys waiting to
        take tourists down to the docks, and I figure there must be a path. It’s a
        good walk, maybe thirty minutes, but pleasant. There’s a good deal of
        commotion on the docks, people coming and going, boats ferrying people
        back to their ships, Santorini only being a stop over for many of the people
        here. Many of the boats also take people out onto the water, and I buy a
        ticket for a sunset cruise tomorrow. It includes time on the volcano island
        and some swim time around the hot springs. I’m blind as a bat without my
        glasses and feel nervous swimming in the ocean wearing glasses. Cross that
        bridge when I come to it.</p>   
    <p>I take the cable car back up to the cliff and generally wander and loiter. No
        hurry and doing just fine with it. It’s sort of become normal for me at this
        point for locals to think I am one of them. The number of times people have
        just started speaking Greek to me is beyond count. At this point, I no longer
        even break the news to them that I’m American unless I have to. I’ve had
        moments of this in India and Jordan, but this is far more extreme. I gotta
        admit I’m enjoying it.</p>
    <p>I eventually return to my hostel, only one other guest, and when the town
        church bell rings nine o’clock, I settle down to record my day’s events and
        unwind. Tomorrow: a beach of red sand, a beach of black sand, a sunset
        cruise, and who knows what else.</p> 
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
