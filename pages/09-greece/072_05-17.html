    <h1>Day 72: The Labyrinth And The Minotaur</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 17 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Heraklion, Greece</h3>   
   
    <p>Rolled out of bed around 0900 and decided I should probably do
        something today. I’m out the door by 0930 and on my way to the ancient
        site of Knossos. It’s about five or six kilometers, so a pretty good walk. I
        must confess that the city of Heraklion is rather drab.</p>
    <p>By 1100 I reach Knossos. It’s open air, in contrast to Akrotiri, and the fresh
        pine air adds a nice touch. And while Akrotiri was frozen perfectly in time,
        Knossos has very slowly and deliberately been worked on. It’s still very
        much a work in progress, using the same materials and techniques
        whenever possible. A few of the load bearers are reinforced, but I’d saythat’s fair. The frescoes have all been removed and spirited away to
        museums, including the one I went to yesterday, but in a significant
        improvement over Akrotiri, copies of the frescoes have been put up in place
        of the originals. It really makes a difference. Still, I’d be lying if I said I felt
        this place breathe like Angkor Wat or Petra. But it is pretty cool.</p>
    <p>I make the walk back, detouring to explore the town and grab a bite. It’s a
        reasonable enough city, but not captivating. Eventually I return to my hotel,
        nonplussed. Tomorrow I sleep in and catch an evening flight. First back to
        Athens, then on to the Holy Land. Here’s to a trip without chaos or death or
        politics.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
