    <h1>Day 73: Athens</h1>
    <h2>Friday 18 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Heraklion, Greece to Jerusalem, Israel</h3>   
   
    <p>Not much of a blog entry for today. I slept in. Fully charged my camera and
        phone, keeping it plugged it till the last minute. I really felt completely done
        with Greece and was just ready to go. It’s nothing on Greece, it’s been
        amazing, it’s like this every time: when I know it’s time to go, then I’m just
        ready to go. I’m done. So I chill in the hotel till check out time and am on
        the street by noon. The airport is only two or three kilometers away, so I
        start walking. I figure I’ll grab some food on the way.</p>
    <p>As it happens, none of the food stands or restaurants I passed seemed very
        inspiring to me, so I just kept walking and grabbed some chow at the
        airport. My hopes of picking up a book to read dashed, I used the airport
        wifi to download the Anansi Boys by Neil Gaiman. Not exactly a sequel to
        American Gods, but certainly a part of the same world. The book holds my
        attention while I wait for my flight to Athens, and while I wait for my flight
        to Tel Aviv.</p>
    <p>The flights were both without incident, and I pull in to Tel Aviv after
        midnight. Which means……to be continued.</p> 
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
