    <h1>Day 66: Athens</h1>
    <h2>Friday 11 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Athens, Greece</h3>   
   <p>Up by 0700 and out the door by 0800. Still having trouble getting to sleep
    before midnight. It’s a good hostel, nice and quiet. Maybe it’s just me.</p>
    <p>By 0815 I am entering the Acropolis grounds. Lots of climbing (not Petra
        climbing, but still a bit of a wake up). At the top of the hill are s few age-
        ruined structures to the north, sits a smaller, more intact temples with
        vertical supports sculpted in the shapes of female figures. These are called
        caryatids, and are quite lovely. But to the south of this hill, much larger and
        in pride of place, the Parthenon. It’s a little bit sad to look at, actually. Time
        has been very harsh to the Parthenon. Three or four different religions have
        claimed and build on the site. I’ve lost track of how many military hands it
        has passed through, from one power to the next. A British diplomat stole
        large portions of it. And the worst indignity, if only in light of its pathetic
        stupidity: the Turkish army used the Parthenon as a storage depot, to hold
        -wait for it – gunpowder, with the inevitable, tragic results. The side
        columns of the Parthenon have been blown away, it’s interior, gutted. But
        still, through all of this, it holds a sense of grandeur and excellence. There is
        no awe, but certainly respect, and a little sadness.</p>
    <p>I take my time through the Acropolis compound, then walk a short distance
        north to the Agora, the ancient market. Mostly just a great many rocks
        laying more or less where they once stood, it does include one startlingly
        well preserved and therefor impressive temple. There is an attached Agora
        Museum, which is small but enjoyable.</p>
    <p>I walk without hurry through the modern day markets, selling shirts and
        scarves, refrigerator magnets, plaster figurines, replica plates and vases,
        and other various odds and ends. I make a stop at Hard Rock Cafe and
        finally, after weeks, I’m able to scratch that itch and get some quality
        nachos. I move on to the second main event of the day.</p>
    <p>The Acropolis Museum. It really is a very lovely museum. Quite modern. In
        many sections, both inside and outside around the door, the floor beneath
        your feet is glass revealing remains of some kind. A street, a few buildings.
        Its quite effective, in my opinion, really helping to set the right tone. Inside
        the museum are many wonderful pieces, all from the Acropolis area, all
        presented clearly and beautifully. On the second floor are more wonderful
        statues, including more of the previously mentioned caryatids. We areshown how they are ever so slowly using laser to clean these caryatids,
        removing the grime to reveal glowing marble once again. I’m quite
        impressed. Then finally, the the third floor. To the real reason this building
        was created. The Parthenon. We are in a large rectangular room the shape
        and dimension of the Parthenon, with the marble sculptures that once
        decorated its heights now at just above eye level, as though we were walking
        a high scaffold around the great temple itself. The temple is too damaged to
        hold all of this safely, so here it is, perfectly presented. And at the east and
        west ends are the great triangular displays. The blank areas make my heart
        ache, lost forever, and the rough plaster for some models leaves me feeling
        quite troubled: these are placeholders for the original works, taken a
        century and a half ago by the British, and now displayed with pride in the
        British Museum. The Greeks have been asking for them back for quite some
        time now, but, as I understand it, the British insisted that these works are
        of great value to all human culture and were quite safe in London. And, as
        Athens had no safe, worthy place to display them… Yet here I stand in this
        state of the art museum. I don’t pretend to know all of the details, nor am I
        suggesting that every museum suddenly give their exhibits, returning them
        to their country of origin. It just feels like the Parthenon, of all things,
        should be in Greece. If the Liberty Bell or the head of the Statue of Liberty
        were on permanent display in London or Paris, yeah I’d say that would sit
        wrong with me. Just saying. Seeing all of this makes the Parthenon even
        more powerful.</p>
    <p>I decide the one big thing I want to see in Athens is the National
        Archeological Museum, and start walking the two kilometers. It’s in nice
        walk through interesting streets. I don’t know if it’s a facet of the city itself,
        or a result unrest here, but there seems to be a great deal of graffiti here.
        And some of it is really amazing. When I finally get to the Archaeological
        Museum, at about 1530, I discover that the financial cutbacks have shut this
        museum at 1500. Sigh. Nothing really to be done about it, I start walking
        back. I enjoyed the walk to, so enjoy the walk back just as well. Perhaps a
        little more: a light rain has started to fall. I haven’t encountered a cool rain
        like this in quite a while. I make a stop for a slouvaki gyro, then chill for the
        night. Up early again tomorrow, bound for Delphi.</p>    
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
