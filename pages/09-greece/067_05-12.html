    <h1>Day 67: Delphi</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 12 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>Athens, Greece and Delphi road trip</h3>   
   
    <p>Awoke and out the door by 0800, then walked a few blocks to the meeting
        point and am picked up by bus for my day trip to Delphi. Our tour guide
        seems nice enough, and some of what she says is pretty basic, and I have
        trouble paying attention. I drift in and out of sleep till we make our first
        stop, a rather unromantic coffee and bathroom break at a roadside spot. I
        grab a breakfast pastry, warm with some sort of ham and cheese, and I pair
        it with the Greek equivalent of a moon pie. Breakfast of champions.</p>
    <p>From here we start heading into the mountains, which are quite beautiful.
        When the bus next stops, we stand over a breath taking vista. We walk to
        the face of the rock and find a mountain spring and an ancient cistern. This
        is the water once used by the Oracles of old. Visitors would come here and
        cleanse themselves after their journey before seeking the wisdom of Apollo.</p>
    <p>From here we walk to the front gate and walk up the mountainside through
        long stretches of ruins. Once long ago this was a place a great wealth and
        influence. Then, with the coming of Christianity, it faded to dust and was
        eventually forgotten, even covered up by a new village. But come the
        nineteenth century, and the interest in the past, this was uncovered and
        slowly, restoration occurs.</p>
    <p>After walking through the Delphi site and seeing the remains of the once
        sacred oracle temple, we walk to the nearby museum, which includes some
        fantastic attempts to imagine Delphi at its height, including a diorama and
        a drawing. The museum is small and obviously focused, but is nonetheless
        compelling. Some of the sculptures there are quite impressive.</p>   
    <p>We wrap up there and have a generic but acceptable Greek lunch as I make
        small talk with a family from Florida. We all pretty much sleep on the bus
        as we return to Athens. Once back, I am hungry again and grab a gyro for
        dinner. I wander the streets until I find a grocery store, always an
        interesting experience when abroad, and pick up some razors and
        toothpaste. More than anywhere I’ve been thus far, I feel completely
        invisible here: I look like a local. People are stunned when I confess that I
        don’t speak Greek.</p>
    <p>I return to my hostel and climb to the rooftop bar for a beer and a sunset.
        Tomorrow, Santorini.</p> 
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
