    <h1>Day 70: Athens</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 15 May 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Santorini to Heraklion, Greece</h3>   
   
    <p>As this is my last day on the island of Santorini, I pack up and check out of
        my hostel, eating a breakfast first. I sling my pack over my shoulders and
        start off down the road. No particular hurry, plenty of time today.</p>
    <p>My first stop is at the Archaeological Museum. It’s small but nice, with
        some fantastic pieces. Alas, some of the most famous frescoes from
        Santorini, the boxers and the fisherman for example, are not here, and I
        can’t seem to get a good answer as to where they are. Alas I fear they are in
        that lovely museum in Athens that was closed when I arrive. And from what
        I am seeing, 1500 is a common closing time for museums. Whether that’s
        from the economic crisis or is a cultural thing I don’t know, but there it is.</p>
    <p>Like I said, it’s a small museum, and I’m out the door again very quickly. I
        take the bus back down to Akrotiri, which I enjoyed so much yesterday, to
        see the excavation site that had been closed. I find it open and with a
        healthy crowd. The site itself has been well cared for, with a very lovely
        building constructed around the site, and wooden walkways to navigate
        through the once thriving village. There is little left now but stone walls, a
        few arches, a staircase here and there. A few bits of intact pottery have been
        left in place here and there. The frescoes have all been removed to
        museums, of course. Very little gold was found here, and no bodies: when
        the volcano blew, it would appear to have given them ample warning. And
        they seemed to have made an orderly evacuation. That, added to the images
        of those frescoes, not of war and power, but of the joys of daily life, it all
        paints a very compelling picture for me. Life here must have been pretty
        good. I cannot help but think, as I walk through these remains, these
        crumbling buildings, that this may very well be a part of Atlantis. It’s not
        out of the question.</p>
    <p>With a touch of sadness I back away from ancient Akrotiri and take my
        leave of Santorini. One last island bus ride, to the new port, not the donkey
        trail port, where I await my ferry in the beautiful sun. The ferry arrives, and
        is quite a sight. Not the typical large flat ferry, this is the speed model, ahydrofoil, with two parallel blades cutting into the water and the body of
        the ship up in the air. Two massive exhaust pipes extend above, great waves
        of heat distortion pouring out from them.</p>   
    <p>We board, and are seated not unlike a wide body airplane, but wider still,
        and the sides of the craft are pure window. We pull away from port and I
        can hardly tell we are moving, the water outside racing past the windows.
        Then, as we leave the shelter of the island, the waves become larger. Great
        waves of water splash violently against the window. The ship rocks
        violently, up and down, side to side as we move. Like some insane roller
        coaster that won’t stop, first entertaining, but it gets old pretty quick.
        Perhaps as many as a full third of the passengers become sick. Even the
        crew are looking a little green. While I am blessed enough to not vomit, I
        will confess to some nausea, a first for me on the water. Two hours of this,
        with attendants running around passing out vomit bags, occasionally seen
        with mop when the waves permit, then we level out a bit as I see land out
        the port side window. It is with no small relief that I disembark on to solid
        land.</p>
    <p>The sun is just about to set as I look around the port of Heraklion on the
        island of Crete. As with Santorini, and much to my surprise, there are no
        seagulls here. Plenty over in Istanbul, but not a one to be seen or heard. It’s
        about one and a half kilometers to my hotel, an easy walk, and I find it with
        no difficulty. It’s an actual hotel, not a hostel, and I get a room to myself. I
        say a prayer of gratitude for my foresight at getting this hotel room at this
        point, almost exclusively for the purpose of getting some rest.</p>
    <p>I enter my room, have a shower, and fall into bed all too soon, all too easy.
        Only a couple sights to see in Crete, and plenty of time. This will be a rest
        stop.</p> 
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
