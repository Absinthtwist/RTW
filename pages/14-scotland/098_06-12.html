    <h1>Day 98: Edinburgh To Reykjavik</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 12 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition Edinburgh, Scotland to Reykjavik, Iceland</h3>  
    <p>Today will be a little less fun than I had initially hoped, but I’d rather a lot
        of time spent reading in an airport than having to spend hundreds on a new
        ticket after I miss a flight, and I’m pretty sure I would. I’m awake by 0630,
        not by choice, my eyes just pop open. I hang out in the hostel common
        room and charge my phone as best I can, no plugs in my room. Eventually,
        daylight burning, I hit the streets and find a good and greasy British
        breakfast complete with blood pudding and the saltiest bacon I’ve ever had.
        I take my time with it, but it’s all too much for me, and I push the plate
        away unfinished.</p>
    <p>I return to the bracing Scottish air and decide to just spend the money and
        be warm. It’s a good call, I’ll need that warmth in Iceland too. So I purchase
        a short red plaid scarf (Clan Wallace, apparently) and a charcoal jumper
        (sweater to my fellow yanks). I pay far too much, but the only currency
        more valuable than money is time, especially right now. I can’t spend an
        hour looking for a good deal, especially so close to tourist central.</p>
    <p>So come 0945, jumper and scarf attired, I figure I have an hour at best. I
        walk across the bridge to explore a huge monument I saw previously, tall
        and pointed like the top of a cathedral, only larger. Closer inspection
        reveals this to be the Scott Monument. That stops me. I’ve seen a great
        many amazing monuments: to kings, to warriors, to saints, gods, but never
        to a writer. This just astounds me. What glorious and wonderful things does
        it say about a culture that prizes literature so highly? I must read up more
        about this. I’ve never read a word of Walter Scott, and suddenly I feel that I
        should.</p>
    <p>Well, the time has come, and I grab my bus and ride to the airport, arriving
        1135. I weigh my pack for curiosity, 13.9kg, that last 4kg is all souvenir crap.
        My pack and I have a seat and start reading, and my flight to London is
        without incident, wheels down at 1600. I have a good chunk of time on my
        hands here, so I grab a bite to eat, finish my book and start a new one, and
        finally am boarding at around 2100.</p>
    <p>As we soar into the air, the sun has only recently set and the evening lights
        are twinkling as we cut through the clouds. In that twilight, watching the
        earth fall away, I am struck again by the magical impossibility of this act, of
        flying. It just seems unreal. As we rise over the clouds, the sun returns,
        hovering at the horizon in perpetual sunset for the remainder of the flight.I set my watch back an hour as we touch ground, 2330, and step out in
        front of the airport to watch ad the sun finally slips below the horizon just
        before midnight. I find my bus into town, but have to wait as it fills up then
        makes the thirty mile trip into Reykjavik. I am nodding off as we drive into
        town then from hotel to hotel, the post- sunset sky holding impossibly, like
        a musician’s high note, unwavering.</p>
    <p>I am dropped off and checked in to my hostel and make it to bed around
        0200, the curtain drawn on the perpetual twilight.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow is a light schedule, just wander the town, see what comes up.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
