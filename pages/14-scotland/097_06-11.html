    <h1>Day 97: Trying To Cram A Gallon Into A Pint</h1>
    <h2>Monday 11 June 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Cracow, Poland, to Edinburgh, Scotland</h3>  
    
    <p>I’m up and out the door by 0700. It’s a short walk to the train station, and
        I’m always a bit nervous with communication gaps, but by 0715 I’m on the
        train and rolling to the airport. As per norm, I’m quite early, and I grab a
        mozzarella panini for breakfast. I sit and wait a bit, and by 1010 we are
        lining up to board the plane.</p>
    <p>There’s an hour’s time difference, and when I land it’s 1215 local. Through
        the usual, passport stamped, find a bus, and I step off in downtown
        Edinburgh at 1330. Fifteen minutes later I’m checking in to my hostel,
        which aside from no power sockets in my room seems fine. I drop off my
        stuff, reorient myself, then am out the door by 1400.</p>
    <p>I start down the Royal Mile in the direction of Edinburgh Castle. I see a
        fabulous cathedral and give it a look. This is Saint Giles Cathedral. If thiswere at the beginning of my trip, I’d be far more impressed, but all the
        same, the church is lovely, and the hints of familiarity, from a culture so
        close to my own, are all very comforting. There’s a side chapel of the Order
        of the Thistle, and stepping in I can see that this church obviously has a
        good deal of significance. The heraldic markings over the reserved seats
        signify Peerage, that is to say a knight at least, perhaps even a lord, and the
        crest at the front is unmistakable: Queen Elizabeth II. She doesn’t have
        seats reserved in every chapel in town.</p> 
    <p>I move down the street reaching Edinburgh Castle at about 1500. Much of
        the castle is actually recent, relatively speaking, but it is still wonderful. The
        hill offers some great views, and I’m sure must have been of some help
        strategically, but not enough. This castle fell more than once. I get a look at
        the Scottish Honor, the crown and regalia of the king of Scotland, no longer
        in use, and the famous Stone of Destiny. This stone, so legend says, has
        featured in the coronation of many a Scottish king. Apparently, the king
        was required to sit or stand upon the stone, no one really knows why. The
        stone was stolen and taken to England back in the bad ol’ days, and was
        returned a few years ago by the Queen, with the understanding that it
        would go back for coronations in the future.</p>
    <p>By 1630 I am finished with the castle and moving on to the Scotch Whisky
        Experience. It’s a more than a bit entertaining, and not as cheesy as it
        sounds. You ride a giant oak barrel like you would at Disneyland (think
        Haunted Mansion cars) and are guided by a Scottish ghost (again, not as
        corny as it sounds, really) through the process of making whisky. It could
        have been terrible, but I was amused. From there a group of us, around
        twenty, are seated in a room with scratch-n-sniff cards (really) as our guide
        explains different flavored and different scotch regions in Scotland. We
        each get a a glass and get to choose one region to sample. More expensive
        tour options include more sampling, but I’m a simple man. I choose
        Speyside, which is strong at around 80 proof, but enjoyable, once I’m past
        the intensity. I’m not a big drinker. We are shown a fantastic collection of
        scotches and we each get to keep our glass.</p>
    <p>At this point it’s about nine or ten hours since I’ve eaten, so I wander until I
        find a good looking pub where I order some sausage and mash.
        AMAZINGLY comforting, if devoid of any vegetation. I take a peek in my
        wallet and sigh. Gone are the days of Thailand or Cambodia, where money
        could go far. I took out way more cash than I thought I’d need and there’snot much left of that left. That first month back home, with almost no
        money until that first paycheck, is really going to smart. I planned on
        having a lot of cash to come back with, that just seems so naive. Of course I
        would spend it all. Of course. Go big or go home, I didn’t come this far not
        to leave it all on the field.</p> 
    <p>I walk around the Old City area, taking a stop at the Last Drop, a pub built
        on the grounds where they used to hang criminals. It’s quite witty, until I
        see the marker showing the spot where many Protestant martyrs were
        burned once upon a time. Not so witty, honestly a bit sobering. I walk
        around a bit longer, but make it back to the hostel for a bathroom break
        and to rest a bit. I chat with my roomies, one from Italy and a couple from
        Norway.</p>
    <p>Around 2130, the sky not yet dark, I go stretch my legs. It’s quite chilly,
        more than I am dressed for. I should think about buying that sweater,
        Iceland and all. I pass the pub where I had dinner earlier, among others,
        but my mood is just not one for a beer in a loud pub. I’ll kick myself in two
        months, but tonight I’ll be present and honest and say after all this time on
        the road, I’m just tired. I head back to my hostel.</p>
    <p>One last bit of business tonight: I feel concerned about my flight tomorrow.
        From Edinburgh to London, then in London from one terminal to another
        in one of the busiest airports in the world at their busiest season. I won’t
        have time to make my connection to Reykjavik. Even assuming everything
        goes right, I’m pushing it far beyond reality. So I drop more money and buy
        an earlier ticket. Which also means less time in Edinburgh in the morning.
        Oh well. A bit depressing, but the journey always has limits. My time in
        Edinburgh has been all too brief, I love it here.</p> 
    <p>I wish I had more time and more money. Don’t we all.</p>
        <p>Safe journey.</p>
