    <h1>Day 52: Tea With Bedouins</h1>
    <h2>Friday 27 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Wadi Rum, Jordan</h3>
    <p>Up and out the door by 0800, saying goodbye to the Petra Mountains. We
        head south and downward, into true desert, into Wadi Rum. Very little of
        the ocean-like forty foot sand dunes here (those are more into the Arabian
        peninsula and north African Sahara), but still vast open space of fine red
        sand, almost like dust, the emptiness broken by giant mountains of rock. I
        am reminded again that all of this was once at the bottom of an ocean, and
        that is very easy to imagine.</p>
    <p>We make it to the village at the edge of Wadi Rum, where the paved road
        abruptly ends, and I trade guides for a few hours. My usual driver shall
        remain behind with his comfortable car, and I get into a Toyota 4×4,
        accompanied by my Bedouin driver. We depart the village and the road and
        drive through the empty sand, great mountains of rock to either side in the
        distance.</p>
    <p>Our first stop is a small well, named either from the Hollywood movie or
        the actual person Lawrence of Arabia. Limits in my guide’s English prevent
        me from clearly understand after whom the well was named, but I let it go.
        I do learn, however, that my guide’s father worked on the 1962 movie, and
        that his grandfather fought and died in the WWI campaign under
        Lawrence. Given my guide’s age, I wonder if language has him skipping a
        generation, but I tend to think, under the circumstances, that he is being
        truthful, even if he actually meant grandfather and great-grandfather. The
        well itself is a bit of a climb up the rock face, then piped down to sand level.</p>
    <p>After looking around and trying to take it all in, I find my guide relaxing in
        a near by Bedouin tent. It’s a large tent, with a full side open to air, and a
        floor covered in beautiful carpets. In a neat row against the back are
        cushions, like sofa cushions, but on the floor. Every six feet or so in line
        with the cushions is a camel saddle, or something put together to look like
        one but more comfortable. Others are relaxed in the tent, some seated
        cross-legged, others leaning against saddles, and still others just lounging
        comfortably on their sides. I am welcomed and invited in, and offered tea or
        coffee. I take a seat and ask for the tea. The tea comes in a small glass, and
        is delicious. I am told that they prepare the tea with a mixture of sage and
        cinnamon and cardamom, and for two dinars I buy a bag of the stuff, only
        afterward imaging trying to explain to customs that it’s really just sage.
        Meh, two dinars. It’s like three bucks. The tea itself was free, and the
        experience and the hospitality are beyond price.</p>
    <p>My driver and I move on to our next goal, off-roading over sand dunes with
        glee. We come to a massive rock rising from the sand, reminding me briefly
        of Uluru, the great Ayers Rock in central Australia. At the center of this
        giant rock is a small fissure, and I go in alone to explore. After climbing
        through a bit, I make the most amazing discovery, no doubt the reason my
        guide brought me here: carvings on the wall, dating from who knows when.
        Some in Arabic, so that could be recent, but other bits, pictographic, looks
        much older. It’s magical.</p>
    <p>Once completed, I hike back and join my guide in another, larger tent, and
        another delicious cup of tea. Enjoying the experience, I allow myself to be
        talked into buying the traditional red and white head scarf of the Jordanian
        man. Someone helps me tie it on well, and I am ready to slip back out into
        the desert. My dark complexion, not for the first time, has many locals
        saying I could easily pass among them. I take it as a compliment and head
        back out into the desert.</p>
    <p>Next my guide takes me to a lovely bit of rock looking out into the endless
        desert. Erosion has worn a lovely window arch into the rock, and if I’m not
        mistaken, this very arch was used to great effect in a very famous shot in
        David Lean’s film (what else could it be?), Lawrence of Arabia. Naturally, I
        stop for a few pictures, then move on.</p>
    <p>After three amazing hours in the desert with my guide, we return to the
        village and I switch both car and driver, and make the long voyage back to
        Amman. It’s about a four hour drive, and I try to get a little rest. Upon
        return to the city, my wonderful guide, Ibrahim, takes me, at my request, to
        a place to get good shawarma, a food I’ve come to love back in the states,
        though honestly, as good as it is, lacks a certain something it gains in the
        export. I still gobble it down with joy, but I confess I’ve had better.</p>
    <p>That’s about it. Tomorrow I actually get to sleep in a bit, then to the airport,
        and to Egypt. I’ve kept my ear to the ground and feel its still safe. Like
        anywhere else: just don’t be stupid and don’t be a dick. I make it an easy
        night, do a little laundry, and get some much needed rest.</p>
    <p>Safe journey!</p>
