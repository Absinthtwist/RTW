    <h1>Day 51: Petra</h1>
    <h2>Thursday 26 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Amman, Jordan with side trip to Petra</h3>
    <p>I make an early start with an 0530 wake up call, have a rushed shower and
        breakfast, and we are out the door by 0615. Mission: Petra. Plan: get there
        before the masses overtake the place.</p>
    <p>This city exists pretty much just for Petra, so it’s a five minute drive to the
        gate. From here it’s a bit of a walk, but a pleasant one. There are brief
        moments of the signature Petra carving, but not a great deal yet. We come
        to what is known as the Siq, I’d guess just under a kilometer through a
        narrow fissure in the rocks, the walls towering up on either side. At
        narrowest, perhaps fifteen feet, thirty feet at the widest. I can already see
        that the magic is not just in the famous carvings, but in the beauty of the
        rocks themselves. Breathtaking sandstone rippling with reds and yellows,
        with veins of black and hints of blues and greens. Once the bottom of an
        ocean, this place is a study in erosion: water, wind, and chisel.</p>
    <p>We round a corner and the fissure opens to reveal the most iconic image of
        Petra: the Treasury. Truly, it is beautiful, reaching fifty feet or more. Now I
        must make something very clear here: for as much as the media ever shows,
        you would think that this one building is Petra. Far from it, Petra was once
        a large city, home to fifty-thousand. They certainly didn’t all climb into that
        one structure.</p>
    <p>The people who created all this were the Nabateans, caravan merchants
        quite good with water management and a chisel, they created an oasis in
        the desert which served as a commercial hub for centuries. This began, as
        best I can tell, around 200 BC, and continued prosperously, being folded
        into the Roman Empire around 100 AD. The Romans built fine roads
        connecting Petra to other major cities in the region, but the new Roman
        presence was to prove ill for the Nabateans. As the Romans put more
        energy into the region, other trade routes took precedent, and Petra faded
        away, to be rediscovered (at least as far as Europeans were concerned) in
        the 1800s. The style of the carved facades in Petra was very clearly
        influenced by Greek and Egyptian art, and later by the Romans. Where the
        Greeks carved marble from a quarry and stacked it up to make a temple, the
        Nabateans would carve that same temple, or at least it’s front, from the
        rock, then carve out a reasonably large chamber inside.</p>
    <p>As for the so-called Treasury, the locals became convinced that that first
        impressive structure they saw had gold hidden away within it somewhere.
        There are still bullet holes where they tried to somehow free the gold. The
        name Treasury stuck, though the building itself was actually a temple.</p>
    <p>In total I spent about ten hours hiking through the truly vast site, up stone
        carved steps when possible, climbing when not. I don’t mind saying I wore
        myself out but good. Some of the best sights were high up and distant, but
        always worth it. Thoroughly exhausted and covered in dust, I returned to
        the entrance for my ride back to the hotel.</p>
    <p>Quite worn out, I still had one adventure left for the day. Though in
        retrospect it seems foolish, but I took a quick shower before heading off for
        my first experience in a Turkish Bath. I told the man there I was new at
        this, and he kindly guided me through the process. I should also mention
        that I fully intended to do this while in Istanbul, and thought of this as a
        sort of trial run, so I had nothing to lose.</p>
    <p>I locked up my belongings in a small locker provided, taking the small key
        around my wrist. I have a towel wrapped about my waist, and I’ve kept my
        underwear on, though I think this was a mistake and I won’t repeat that
        next time. I am led to my first sauna experience, which was quite intense.
        At first it felt like a macho dare: how much heat can you take, but I let
        myself relax into it and it became enjoyable. Then I cooled off in an
        adjoining steam room, though no where near as hot. I am next led to a
        room where I am rinsed off with bowlfulls of pleasantly hot water. Next my
        skin is scrubbed by an abrasive cloth. I am rinsed again, then led to yet
        another room. I lay on a table and am lathered up and scrubbed. What
        comes next can charitably be called a massage, but also might be called
        brutality. He shoves into my muscles in some pretty painful ways. I am
        again rinsed off, then given fresh towels, and led to yet another room to sit
        and sip a pleasant tea. Painful, but wonderful. Feeling like rubber, I return
        to my room and am ready for a deep sleep.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
