    <h1>Day 50: Middle-Eastern Road Trip</h1>
    <h2>Wednesday 25 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>Amman, Jordan and Points Beyond</h3>
    <p>Awake at 0630, showered and fed, then packed and out the door by 0800. I
        am reminded, as we start driving, why this part of my journey is more
        expensive. The rest of my trip involves exploring a single area, a city. With
        Jordan, my explorations take in a much broader area. Not a city but a
        country. And now that I think about it, Jordan may not be my most
        expensive stop, that honor may fall to Iceland, and for similar reasons. I’m
        there to see the country, not Reykjavik.</p>
    <p>We exit Amman and take a lovely road toward our first destination. Green
        pastures and trees are a common sight, and we actually stop to look at
        flowers on our drive. The black iris, a local variety, which only blooms for a
        couple weeks out of the year. Quite lovely.</p>
    <p>Our first stop is the town of Madaba. It’s very charming, with brightly
        colored banners hung on every street. Ibrahim translates for me and says
        that it appears as though the King will be coming for a visit in a few days.
        We come to our goal, the Greek Orthodox Basilica of St George. St George is
        a saint I typically associate with the knight class, and chivalry, which fits
        well. The church, which I believe dates back to the sixth century A.D.,
        became famous rather recently, just over one hundred years ago, when
        beautiful mosaics were discovered under the floor. A very large and truly
        amazing mosaic map of the Holy Land, expressing a moment in history.
        Right there under people’s feet unseen for a millennium or more.</p>
    <p>From here we drive through more amazing countryside, becoming more
        arid and elevated, until we come to Mt Nebo. A very holy place. Moses led
        the chosen people out of Egypt, taking them to the promised land, a place of
        milk and honey. Moses never set foot on that promised land, but instead
        died in sight of it, here on this mountain top. The view extends out into the
        hazy distance, and one can make out the dark shape of the Dead Sea, and
        more distant and less clear, Jericho, and of course, a spec on the horizon,
        Jerusalem.</p>
    <p>From here we drive down and down, through switchbacks and rocky
        terrain, our ears popping, as we drop far below sea level, to the lowest body
        of water that’s not an ocean. The Dead Sea, a rather large inland lake, with
        a profoundly high salt content. We pass a few resorts, and soon get to the
        more striking images. The rocks where the water laps at the edge are frosty
        white, and the water glimmers with hints of pearlescent greens and blues.</p>
    <p>Our road takes us back into the mountains, arid but never scorching, and
        we stop for a Turkish coffee at a shack at the top of a great hill in the middle
        of no where. The view extends on forever in a way that no camera can ever
        capture. I can see the rolling hills and great rocky terrain give way to true
        desert far in the distance.</p>
    <p>We drive further and come to a real treat. Ash Shubak, once a crusaders’
        castle that had withstood a siege from Saladin himself. In poor shape now,
        it is still quite compelling. I know there are other, far better preserved
        crusader castles, but this is still amazing to me. Perched atop a hill in the
        middle of nowhere, the crusaders were able to hold their legendary
        opponent off by digging through the depth of the entire freakin’ hill to get
        to potable water. That’s commitment. Walking through the ruins, I can’t
        help thinking how this would never be open to the public in America. No
        guard rails, deathly ledges everywhere, and the walls themselves look about
        ready to go. Very cool.</p>
    <p>We stop for a bite to eat, chicken and rice, and I am filled near to bursting.
        The day is getting on, so we make for one more stop near our final
        destination for the day. This place is called Little Petra, for it’s similarity to
        the main attraction, but dramatically smaller in scale. This, apparently, was
        something of an experiment, a previous attempt leading to the better result
        of its more famous neighbor. And let me say, if not for that neighbor, this
        site would be a far more loudly hailed attraction. Truly amazing to see.
        Rooms carved into the giant rocks, elaborate exteriors on a handful of
        them. Hints of how the rooms were, once upon a time, elaborately painted.
        The steps leading to the upper level chambers, some were two story, are
        well eroded. Two thousand years will do that every time.</p>
    <p>From here, we drive to my hotel where I do my sink laundry and pop what I
        can onto the web. Tomorrow: Petra!</p>
    <p>Safe journey!</p>
