    <h1>Day 49: Amman</h1>
    <h2>Tuesday 24 April 2012</h2>
    <h3> Transition from New Delhi, India to Amman, Jordan</h3>
    <p>My trip to Agra has worn me out, and my day is far from done. Just past
        midnight when I get in, starting in on Tuesday. I grab a shower and pack
        up, squeeze in a power-nap, and am riding a taxi to the airport by 0230.</p>
    <p>Security, etc has me at my gate just before 0400, and they are boarding
        shortly thereafter. I am really ready for bed. I nod off a bit on the plane, but
        nothing I’d really call sleep. I watch an in-flight movie, the most recent
        mission impossible, which was kinda blah.</p>
    <p>Now it’s worth mentioning that, dollar for day, this is by far the most
        expensive leg of my trip, at about twice the base cost. Why did I do this?
        Well, I had a short space of time and things I wanted to see, I had an
        awareness that after India a little pampering might not go amiss, and
        frankly, as an American in the Middle-East, there was the tiniest bit of
        nervousness, especially with Arab Spring Politics changing the game. I am
        not proud of this, but there it is.</p>
    <p>That said, I must say Jordan is wonderful so far. I try not to let India blow
        the grading curb, but regardless, Jordan reminds me why I travel. Clean,
        charming, the weather is fantastic – San Diego weather. I am greeted by my
        guide at the airport and we drive to Amman. My guide’s name is Ibrahim,
        and he is humorous and informative, and his english is quite good. We
        decide on 0800 for a start tomorrow, enough time for breakfast, but still
        early.</p>
    <p>I am led to my room, which is cozy and comfortable, and I open my curtains
        for the noon view of Amman, just in time to hear the call to prayer start. Isuppose there are some Americans that might feel uncomfortable hearing
        that sound, but I find it very beautiful, very haunting, and an excellent
        welcome. There’s no denying that India threw me off my game, good to
        back in my comfort zone. The thought that the Middle East made me
        nervous just sounds embarrassing now.</p>
    <p>My body demands a nap, but I keep it at ninety minutes lest I stay awake all
        night and hate tomorrow. After feeling groggy and useless for thirty
        minutes, I head out to see a bit of the city.</p>
    <p>Even without the benchmark of India, Jordan is fantastic. People are
        friendly and helpful, the streets are reasonably clean, and the music is
        catchy. Many women do cover their hair, though this is not obligatory and
        many other women do not. A few women cover everything but their eyes,
        others wear short sleeves and skirts, indistinguishable from the west. Of the
        many women who do choose to cover their hair, I am impressed by how
        alluring they can be: beautiful figures well accented, gorgeous faces. I am
        struck with the notion that, when possible, women will continue to find
        ways to be beautiful. One woman’s obstacle is another woman’s challenge.
        Needless to say, there are some disturbingly extreme cases out there, but
        nothing like that is apparent here. As if to underline a point I’m still
        digesting, I walk through a popular mall and can very clearly see that
        Amman has a thriving lingerie trade. Gotta say, that knowledge puts a new
        spin on my thoughts on the hijab.</p>
    <p>While in the mall, I do my one adventurous deed for the day and get my
        hair cut. My stylist spoke passable English, and it went alright, but I can’t
        say I exactly look my sexiest. Oh well. At least it’s not hanging in my eyes
        any more.</p>
    <p>I make the walk home, wash some clothes and take it easy. At dusk I once
        again hear the call to prayer, and once again I am struck by its beauty. I
        have left the far east behind and entered a different world.</p>
    <p>Safe journey.</p>
