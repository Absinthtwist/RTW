    <h1>Day 53: The Half Way Point</h1>
    <h2>Saturday 28 April 2012</h2>
    <h3>transition from Amman, Jordan to Luxor, Egypt</h3>
    <p>As my journey is projected at one hundred and six days, today marks my
        half way point. It is also my departure from Asia – for now – to the
        continent of Africa.</p>
    <p>A rather straight forward day. Out of the hotel around 0900. Last drive
        around Amman before the airport. A quick flight over to Cairo. Cairo
        airport is large and modern and lovely… and empty. The few people walking
        its corridors only serve to emphasize its emptiness, like ghosts haunting its
        halls.</p>
    <p>I make my connecting flight to Luxor and am met by the cab driver sent my
        my hotel. The ride into town is fantastic. On the west bank of the Nile, time
        has stopped. People are still living the same way as hundreds of years ago
        (with a few conspicuous exceptions). I saw a farmer working his field
        pulling a cart by animal power. The east bank, in comparison, is where you
        find the Hilton and the McDonalds.</p>
    <p>My hotel, and I use this term in the broadest possible sense, seems quite
        cool. It is not so much a hotel as a permanent camp site. It is perhaps not
        luxurious but certainly comfortable, and more to the point, very welcoming.
        I am greeted by the owner who sits and talks with me about my plans here
        in Luxor, and insists that I make myself at home. The rooms are small
        bungalows, with shower and toilet a short walk away. My bungalow is made
        of strong reeds of some sort, like thin bamboo. On the inside the reeds are
        all horizontal, and I glimpse a layer behind that vertical. There is a ceiling
        fan, a mosquito net, and a firm but large bed. It will do nicely, I think.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow I wake early, then off to see the Valley of the Kings! Hard to be
        blasé about that.</p>
    <p>Safe journey!</p>
